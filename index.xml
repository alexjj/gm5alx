<p>After activating <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/">Ben Avon</a>, and a brief stop for some food, it was time to head back to The Sneck and then up to Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird.</p>

<p>The frozen burns were interesting, some I could walk over, and some were only partially frozen. The small waterfalls would trap air underneath and then the bubbles would travel under the ice for a few meters before escaping.</p>

<p>The summit was hard to find, my GPS route had come to an end but I couldn‚Äôt see anything. Some general blind amberling around eventually found it hidden in the cloud. I was a bit disappointed in the cairn, I was hoping I could at least hide in it, and even when crouched down behind it, the wind still got me.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to spend ages messing about, trying to get setup on HF, but nothing would stay still. The wind pulled out guys and pegs, it bent the top of mast over 90¬∞ and so wires would come off, I angled the mast 35¬∞ off the ground into the wind, and the top still bent over enough for the wire to be pulled off. I held the mast with my body weight but still the wind could pick me up with only the surface area of the mast! Just when I had everything set for 40m it all blew down :sweat_smile: I thought I‚Äôd try 2m but that was just as challenging. I could hear the local lunch time net in Aberdeen but it was hard to get a word in edgeways and I‚Äôm not sure they could hear me anyway. So back to HF it was, this time with a short 5.5m vertical random wire for 20m. This I did manage to make some contacts with but, again, the wind blew me and the mast over mid-way through a QSO. By this time I was fed up, cold and wet, but had qualified the summit, so it was time to go! Also, there was no signal just behind the cairn‚Ä¶to add to the fun.</p>

</div>
<p>I generally took the same route back, without a compass, or device with a compass, it would be impossible to know which way to go. At one point on the way back it was so windy I could lean into the wind and it would hold me up! But I was soon back at The Sneck and heading down, and it wasn‚Äôt long before the conditions were more pleasant again. The weather wasn‚Äôt quite so nice down in the valley on the way back, but much nicer than on the summits. Found my bike, generally took the same route back, and was pleased to arrive back at the car to drive home.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After a lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar trip</a> the other week (with the now amusing subtitle of windy munro), I was keen to do some more high summits before the weather got worse and the darkness set in. Although turns out the weather is already worse! It‚Äôs school holidays here, so with no family schedule constraints, I could go out for the whole day, and I decided to try these two big uns - Ben Avon and Beinn A‚ÄôBhuird, pronounced Ben Ann and Ben a Vour respectively.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="route.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Journey there and back"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/route.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Journey there and back"></a></p>
<figcaption>Journey there and back</figcaption>

</div>
<p>The route is pretty standard for these two, parking at Keiloch, paying the ¬£3.50, then cycling, before hiking. I decided to bike as far as I could towards The Sneck (the T junction between the two summits at 986m), and just retrace my steps from Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird back. This is instead of doing the loop where you walk from Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird North Top (the full summit name) to South Top across the plateau, then down the side and meet the path again after crossing Quoich Water. As I could see the low cloud I thought I‚Äôd rather not be walking that route for the first time, and just retrace my steps. Although given my ‚Äúretracing‚Äù aka wildly veering route, and the completely indistinguishable terrain, it probably didn‚Äôt matter. It also meant more cycling on the way in, which helped my timing, for a chance of a good summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, on Mull.</p>

<p>The route in has a few parallel paths, including the Fairy Glen, and I‚Äôm not sure I took the best ones, and had to push the bike up some steep rocky parts in places. I tried the other way on the way back and it wasn‚Äôt much better, and then I missed the turn and went through the Fairy Glen - although didn‚Äôt see the secret howff (a hidden bothy), but also didn‚Äôt look very hard as I wanted to get back.</p>

<p>The weather was reasonable in the morning, patches of sun between the clouds and fairly mild for 8am. The forecast had the summits in cloud with strong winds, 30-40 mph with gusts of 50 mph. However, until I got to The Sneck, there was minimal wind, but boy, once I did! üå¨Ô∏è It was absolutely relentless, with my hood acting like a reed in a trumpet with an enthusiastic player. I gave the edge a wide berth, not trusting myself if there was a sudden gust that I wasn‚Äôt braced for. Snow was minimal on the way to the Ben Avon summit, with just small pockets that resisted being blown away.</p>

<p>Out of the mist the tor emerges and I have arrived! Peaking through the rock formation - which acted like the mouth piece of the trumpet - revealed more snow on that side.</p>

<p>I found a nice rock to hide behind and setup the slim G on the carbon mast. My last activation on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-030/">Carn a‚ÄôGheoidh</a>, suffered a lot from the mast bending too much in the wind and the antenna sliding off. Up until this point, I‚Äôd forgotten about this and so hadn‚Äôt prepared anything else. Luckily the slight sheltering seem to keep the antenna on and I managed to make my QSOs. The most exciting was a summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, who‚Äôs on Mull and was up <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SI-016">GM/SI-016</a>, 100 miles away. We were both on HTs and slim G antenna!</p>

<p>A pretty big sun CME hit and caused some lovely aurora all around the UK, however, this meant the bands were wrecked this morning. K of 7. Although dxheat was showing 40m activity in Europe this morning so I thought I‚Äôd try it. I had wanted to do some 20m to get a some nice EU contacts, as I thought that might be more interesting.</p>

<p>My mum is visiting and after all the sunny hillside photos I‚Äôve been sending her, she wanted to come out and see the sights for herself. The weather wasn‚Äôt quite as spectacular as recent outings to <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">An Socach</a>, but it was nice enough. After we dropped the kids at school, we headed up. There‚Äôs a dedicated car park, Tap O‚ÄôNoth car park, and a nice track all the way to the top, so it was a straight forward walk. My mum did have a stroke about 11 years ago, and that does limit her at times. I‚Äôd hoped this summit wouldn‚Äôt be too much for her. When you arrive you‚Äôre greeted with this huge lump that sticks out of the ground and looks imposing, I thought I took a photo but it appears not.</p>

<p>With a few stops on the way, we all made it to the top in good time. The cloud had come in a little and it was much windier but still decent weather. The top of this hill used to be a fort back in the Dark Ages, and so offers plenty of shelter from the wind.</p>

<p>I setup near the trig point in a nice recess in the side. I‚Äôd brought the G90 and my 5.5m vertical random wire. The G90 can match this tiny length of wire on any band, even 40m! Although probably longer wires would be better. I‚Äôd also brought my end fed half wave, but the 5.5m vertical is so fast to setup. As I was worried the novelty of watching me on the radio would wear off soon, and the cold wind would get to everyone, I stuck with this vertical. I gave 40m a shot, and did manage to just hear Phil, G4OBK. We were both 31 with each other. I then heard my HT as locals were chatting and asking if I‚Äôd already been and gone or what had happened. I‚Äôd emailed earlier in the day saying I was going up but had put 11am and we‚Äôd left later so it was closer to 11:30am.</p>

<p>I had the RH-770 on the HT and joined in the conversation, saying I was on the summit. Simon, GM4JXP, and Chris, 2M0RVZ, quickly called in and I was more than qualified. Simon was testing a new home made 5 el yagi and was absolutely deafening when he called! I tried one more CQ but I‚Äôd done the job so thought it was time I packed up and headed down - we didn‚Äôt want to be late for lunch! My mum liked the chats we all had on 2m, and said everyone sounded very friendly. If I had been on 20m or higher frequencies, it might‚Äôve been exciting countries but nothing more than callsigns and RST exchanges.</p>

<p>The trip down was easy enough, we actually met a few other walkers on their way up, and we were back in the car heading to Alford to try out a cafe for lunch. Soup and sandwiches all round with a sense of accomplishment by all. A very enjoyable trip out. Tap O‚ÄôNoth will be a good one to do during the Winter bonus period (30 Nov-14 Mar) to get 5 points from it! The shelter the old fort offers is very nice for keeping out of the cold winds!</p>

  <title>Getting started with Bunkers on the Air</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/bunkers-on-the-air/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I‚Äôve heard about it before but only just looked into bunkers on the air (or UK BOTA). Turns out there are a lot of sites around and good way to get out and about, use the radio, explore your local region and maybe learn a little bit of history.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a list of useful sites to get you going:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bunkersontheair.org/site/">Main site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bunkerbase.org/">Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bunkerbase.org/bunker-3/">Maps</a>
<ul>
<li>The Google Map didn‚Äôt appear for me, but the OS map is nice, or use the combined on below:</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://kwirk.github.io/pota-gb-map/">Combined awards map</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be within 1000 m of the bunker location (with the right permissions etc.)</li>
<li>Qualify the bunker with 25 HF contacts or 10 VHF+ contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôd recommend joining the WhatsApp group listed on the website, and you‚Äôll get invited to the spotting group too.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the number of bunkers locally to me, especailly compared to doing SOTA activations and having to drive at least an hour to get anywhere!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve not activated one yet but there appear to be plenty that have never been done near me.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After a lovely day yesterday on Lochnagar and Conachcraig, I was looking to see where I could go today. There was a swimming competition on, in addition to the usual activities, so I needed to be back for 3pm. Last week when I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">An Socach</a>, the others went to Carn a‚ÄôGheoidh, and I remembered them leaving later than me but arriving at the top at the same time. Sure enough when I check all the times, it looked doable to get there and back in time. The longest part is the drive to Glenshee ski centre, and that‚Äôs right at the limit of the electric car - returning home with 20 miles range still makes me a little nervous!</p>

<p>The weather forecast had it cloudy with chance of showers and reasonably breezy. It did rain a little on the way out but was dry when I arrived. I wasted about 10 minutes getting a parking ticket from the cafe - I should‚Äôve just opened the link in the car park when I was up the hill and had signal, like I did with Glas Maol.</p>

<p>The track follows up the ski maintenance tracks, which are quite steep to start. There‚Äôs a shortcut across part way up which I just walked right past. My Inreach mini started beeping as I‚Äôd gone of course and so I backtracked and found it. It was a small track at right angles to the main path just behind a fence, so not too obvious, so thanks to the Garmin!</p>

<p>I was soon in the cloud and did check on the inreach every so often to make sure I was heading in the right direction. I doesn‚Äôt have topo maps, and just a line but it has a compass and so points in the right direction and is enough to make sure you‚Äôre following the right path.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt see much on the way up, other than about 20m around me, mostly looking like the photo. In exposed places the wind picked up a lot and gave me a good push. At one point I was about 3m from a small loch and I didn‚Äôt realise until I was right upon it. The track was decent and only in a few places was it boggy but nothing like The Buck. The final ascent to the summit is steep again after a while of walking on the mostly flat plateau. At this point the wind was howling and I was glad there was a cairn at the top.</p>

<p>I setup behind the cairn, which was a very good shelter from the wind, had a sandwich and then got on the air. I thought I‚Äôd try a bit more power on 2m and see if I could get any further than usual. I‚Äôd brought the Kenwood V71 and battery. This is the first time I‚Äôve taken it out with me, and I also haven‚Äôt used it much at home, so I was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt get into any operating issues with it! I had the slim G, and was glad I hadn‚Äôt brought the yagi to try and setup in the wind.</p>

<p>I now wonder if I‚Äôd setup the mast on the outside of the cairn pointing into the wind, if I could‚Äôve made it more vertical. Particularly as right at the end the antenna got blown off and I ended up holding it with my arm to finish the QSO - I didn‚Äôt do an EMF assessment on that setup‚Ä¶</p>

<p>It was a little slow to start, but eventually I‚Äôd work 9 stations, including GM4OAS 90 miles to the west in Mallaig. I did find the lowest squelch on the V71 was quite high and not breaking for several stations. I eventually turned it off and then heard several locals and others. I do wonder how many had been replying to my CQs before. Did 50W make any difference? The map looks remarkably similar to when I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-012/">Glas Maol</a>, and that was with the 5W D72 handheld. Technically, it‚Äôs 10 dB which is 1.x S points, and on Glas Maol GM4OAS gave me 32 and this time he gave me 42, so whilst not more power, I was readable more? I do like the form factor of using the mobile rig with the fist mic, means I can position things easier than being tied directly to the end of the mast, but probably for the most part it makes no real difference and it‚Äôs all in my head!</p>

<p>Keeping an eye on the time, I needed to pack up and head back. The wind was still relentless and on the top I had to lean into it. I was grateful of my big hood as I followed the path back down. It‚Äôs amazing how you can forget some of the details of the walk on the way back, being surprised that I had to climb up and down a few places which I didn‚Äôt remember on the way up to the summit! For a few moments the wind seemed to blow the clouds away and there was even a hint of sunshine coming through. The view opened up and I could see all around. Certainly not the spectacular views of <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">last week</a>, but enjoyable for the few moments. Back down to the car and back home.</p>

<p>I think this summit and Glas Maol would make a nice day trip out, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with the option of a hot lunch at the ski centre cafe. For 6 and 8 pointers, they have fairly easy and short walks, and both great locations for 2m, particularly to the south. Doing both would be 14 points, and a lot less walking and climbing than my 14 point day yesterday on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-019/">Conachcraig</a>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I‚Äôve been eyeing Lochnagar <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-008">GM/ES-008</a> for a while, and this Thursday‚Äôs forecast was looking reasonable, so decided to take the day off. It‚Äôs little neighbour, Conachcraig <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-019">GM/ES-019</a>, is asking to be activated at the same time. I was going to take the common route starting at Glenmuick, but Fraser, MM0EFI, suggested biking from Balmoral castle.</p>
<p>As I was trying to fit this into the family schedule, any time I could save would be an advantage. I used <a href="https://www.plotaroute.com/">plotaroute</a> to figure out the times for the biking and hiking sections, matching the speed I think I move at, plus the drive back and forth, it looked like the cycle route would be the quickest. 8:05 hrs for the cycle route vs.&nbsp;8:40 for the walk from Glenmuick (times include driving). I considered cycling from Glenmuick but supposedly the path isn‚Äôt great beyond the forest, so not really worth it.</p>
<p>Was only a few degrees at the start in Crathie car park, but cycling generally uphill and in the sun I was soon roasting! It was around 1:15 cycle up to the intersection of Lochnagar and Conachcraig and I‚Äôd had enough of the bike! Much of the route is a gentle incline but there are areas where it‚Äôs steeper and much less enjoyable.</p>

<p>I met a nice German couple on the way up Lochnagar. They‚Äôd been in Scotland for nearly 3 weeks and had brillant weather all round. Climbed Ben Nevis, Ben Lomond and visited several cities and towns.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‚ÄúOf course the weather is always like this‚Äù.</p>

<p>A german ham I know told me: ‚ÄúNice German‚Äù is as redundant as ‚Äúfalse error‚Äù or ‚Äúundead zombie‚Äù. His choice of words. Enough chit-chat, I had a schedule to keep and kept going.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve not been on a popular summit for a while and was surprised to see so many people on a random Thursday. I say so many people, it probably it was about 15, but compared to zero to two, it seemed a lot.</p>
<p>The forecast had said cloudy in the afternoon and I was due on the summit at 1300 local so I was hoping it would stay clear. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.</p>

<p>I waited my turn in the queue to take photos at the summit, offering to take those of others.

<p>I‚Äôd made it to the top ahead of schedule but I spent a long time admiring the views and walking around. The wind was strong so I looked for somewhere sheltered and away from the main path to setup, but ended up just sitting on the grass to one side. With my back to the wind it wasn‚Äôt too bad. I setup the slim G on the 6m mast and used my HT to call CQ. I was hoping to qualify the summit on 2m and in short order to keep on my way. I also noticed the clouds rolling in from the south. Got 5 in the log, mostly the locals plus Jace MM7VXJ who called when I was eating a biscuit. Credit to Jace for trying to relay messages to Jack, GM4COX, who was a 59 for me but think I was a 01 for him, and he wanted to move to sideband. I was surprised not to get anyone else further south.</p>

<p>Time to head back. I should‚Äôve taken a photo of Conachcraig from the summit, as it looked tiny from atop Lochnagar! All around the cliff edges are openings that just drop away, and on a lovely sunny day they‚Äôre interesting to look at but if it were cloudy these are a literal death trap!</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">big hill</a>, it was time to do the small one - <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-019">Conachcraig</a>. It certainly looked small from Lochnagar summit but it‚Äôs still a respectable 865m tall.</p>

<p>The rock formations on Conachcraig are interesting to look at, I haven‚Äôt really got a good photo of them so you‚Äôll have to go there yourself. Unsurprisingly, no-one else was at this summit with me and I ducked down behind a rock to keep out the wind whilst I setup again on 2m.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ for their contacts on both summits, then with Simon, GM4JXP, and finally Richie, GM1LKD, in Aberdeen I was set. It was now 3:05pm, and I needed to be home by 5pm, and with an hour+ drive, it was time to pack up and head back to my bike.</p>

  <title>Waughton Hill</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/906901577214402/?locale=en_GB">145 Alive!</a> event was planned for today between 1-3pm, which I wanted to join in with. Should be the perfect time to activate a summit on 2m! I had the three little kids with me for the day, so it had to be a easy summit. Particularly as I wanted to bring up the tent and lunch and things for them, to keep them entertained whilst I was on the air. The previous times I‚Äôve brought them, I‚Äôve only been about 20 minutes at most and trying to go much longer would be tricky. Eventually I want to qualify all the GM/ES summits, and so Waughton hill is on my list. It‚Äôs quite out of the way with nothing else nearby, so it‚Äôs a trip in itself and for one point, I‚Äôm not wasting a day off on it! It‚Äôs also the lowest summit in GM/ES, and seemed perfect for our adventure.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="Waughton1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="White Horse"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-087/Waughton1.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="White Horse"></a></p>

<p>The path up is short, although does cross a field full of cows, and you soon find yourself by the white horse. Walk by its head and you‚Äôre on the top of the rise, and heading towards the old hunter‚Äôs cottage. The actual summit is a bit further away, requiring you to go down and up the side of the hill again. However, the hunter‚Äôs cottage is in the activation zone and the kids thought we‚Äôd reached the top and started playing in the house. There was also a nice piece of grass without any sheep or animal droppings on it for the tent I‚Äôd brought. The tent and mast went up easily enough and lunch and various toys were unloaded into the tent. It was about 12:55 and I wanted to be on the air for the start of the event, so I swallowed down my rolls and setup the IC-705. Turns out the coax on the slim G with the 6m tactical mini mast is just a little too short for the radio to be on the ground. I usually don‚Äôt notice as either using the carbon 6, where the antenna sits a little lower on it, or a HT which I‚Äôm holding at standing height. So I ended up having to hold the 705 in my hand the whole time.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve not long had the IC-705 and whilst it is very simple to use, sometimes I get into some modes or settings that I don‚Äôt know how to get out of. Today I was already on 2m FM but would the VFO change the frequency? No.&nbsp;First I was worried I‚Äôd bashed it in my bag and the dial was broken, then thought perhaps I‚Äôd selected 10 or 100 Hz increment but that didn‚Äôt seem to matter. I ended up just pressing stuff and then going to band and choosing 144 MHz again seemed to fix it. Phew!</p>

<p>It was nice having the waterfall to see is there was any activity and there certainly was some! I knew MM0EFI and MM0RFN were going up Ben Macdui and Glas Maol respectively, but not sure if they‚Äôd got to the summit in time. Fraser was supposed to be on 145.250, so I tuned to it and heard Bill, GM0NRT, talking to someone but couldn‚Äôt hear the other end. I was worried I couldn‚Äôt hear Fraser on Ben Macdui, but turned out was just someone else. Tuning around, I heard a guy down at the car park by <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-085/">Hill of Garvock</a> and ended up qualifying the summit with those on his net. I managed to work four summit to summits, two on Ben Macdui, Glas Maol and then Morven. I heard a station down in East Lothian calling on 145.500 but he didn‚Äôt hear my reply. After about an hour, I had 10 QSOs and thought it was about time we packed up.</p>

<p>We headed back down, and went to <a href="https://adencountrypark.org.uk/">Aden Country Park</a> for some more fun. Turned out to be an old timey tractor fair and there were loads of them on the roads as we drove there.</p>
<p>Was a fun day all round, and nice to join in with this event. Maybe next time I‚Äôll try for a higher summit!</p>
<p>The guys up Ben Macdui had a <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/carn-amhaim-gm-es-013-ben-macdui-gm-es-001-slightly-broken/36399">fun trip.</a>. Not jealous in the slightest‚Ä¶üòÖ Also afterwards, Chris, 2M0RVZ, was boasting about his points compared to mine‚Ä¶challenge accepted!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Fraser, MM0EFI, messaged asking who wanted to do a Munro midweek, and I thought it was a good opportunity to go. He also rallied Chris, 2M0RVZ, and Simon, GM4JXP. I decided to go up An Socach, whilst Fraser and Chris were going up Carn a‚ÄôGheoidh, and Simon on Glas Maol. A notice was posted on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/upcoming-2m-activity-wednesday-25th-september/36335/65">reflector</a>, and several others were keen to go up summits in Scotland and England. Later on we came to realise that the time posted on the reflector and Alerts was two hours late! Oops‚Ä¶no wonder no-one else turned up ‚Äúat the right time‚Äù.</p>

<p>I got to the start around 7:45, and it was a chilly start, with -1.5 degC in Braemar as I drove through, however, the weather was stunning with clear blue skies and not a breath of wind.</p>
<p>I cycled along the estate track until the actual ascent starts - probably saves about 20-30 minutes walking each way, as I thought Fraser and Chris would have a quicker walk back on their summit. I need to buy an actual mountain bike as this and Mount Keen the other week have felt like I was going to shake the bike, and me, to pieces. The bike made a helpful support when crossing the ford before turning up the hill.</p>

<p>The first cairn is only 6m below the actual summit but still around 2km away. At this point I called in with Fraser and Chris on the HT, and they were a similar 1.5km away from their summit.</p>

<p>Lots of good views and, as already said, lovely weather! I found a nice grassy patch near to the cairn to setup the yagi.</p>

<p>Some good QSOs on 2m FM and SSB, not quite what Fraser managed but his summit was higher and so he was in the way! üòÖ</p>

</div>
<p>After calling for a long time on sideband I was impatient on FM and kept jumping around when I saw activity on the waterfall, either following Fraser like an annoying puppy, or jumping onto the calling frequency when it was free. Probably should‚Äôve just stayed still!</p>
<p>I made use of the flat plateau and large activation zone to start heading back but still ready with the HT for Alan, MM0VPM. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sota-goat/id590206108">SotaGoat</a> app kept me in check and that saved a bit of time coming back. My worries of being slow down were unnecessary as I ended up being at the Bothy for a full round of cakes before the others arrived‚Ä¶and I couldn‚Äôt let them feel guilty for eating in front of me.</p>
<p>G4IPB reported hearing me on from <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/G/LD-008">Blencathra</a> - in the lake district just north of Keswick - and after seeing his report I realised that I also heard him but we were in the middle of some other QSOs so I never followed up and changed frequency. I was only on the HT and RH770 but he‚Äôd give me 55 and he was clear to me, although the first QSO was a bit muffled and dogs barking made it unclear.</p>
<p>The views were spectacular all around, with snow on the high summits.</p>

  <title>Largo Law</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My wife and I had a trip away for the weekend, and I suggested a nice walk nearby‚Ä¶which of course was a SOTA summit! We were staying near St.&nbsp;Andrews, which is quite a flat area, however, there are a few granite lumps you can climb. Today‚Äôs one was Largo Law. If the weather was good, we‚Äôd have a lovely view of the Forth, Edinburgh and East Lothian. However, that wasn‚Äôt the case today‚Ä¶more like gray and cloudy.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="largolaw-4.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Summit ahead!"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-ss-259/largolaw-4.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Summit ahead!"></a></p>

</div>
<p>The route is straight forward, as shown on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-259">Sotlas</a>, park at the school/cemetery, up towards the farm and then straight up the hill! The track was tricky in places as the ground was dry and covered in loose soil, but we made it up fine.</p>

<p>I setup the slim g on the 6m carbon mast, put out a spot and called CQ. It took a few calls but stations did start coming back. Good coverage across Glasgow, Edinburgh and up to Montrose area. Had a nice chat with GM4PKJ, who lives very close to where we used to live around 10 years ago. His wife is a ham too, but I didn‚Äôt realise until I got home and looked him up on QRZ, otherwise I could‚Äôve said hi to her too.</p>

<p>Got my four contacts and packed up. My wife was sat nearby and commented the radio conversation was so ‚Äúold man‚Äù. It was mostly what‚Äôs the weather and setup but I probably do adopt some old man tendencies when talking‚Ä¶it‚Äôs as though you‚Äôve got to fit in. I should just ignore that and say whatever I want. Although I do like describing the weather on a summit, as quite often it‚Äôs different from ‚Äúground‚Äù level.</p>

<p>I had my Lora tracker with me and looked up if I‚Äôd been tracked. Two stations across the water had followed me up and down the summit. One was a new one in the centre of Edinburgh owned by <a href="https://gm5aug.topple.scot/">GM5AUG</a>.</p>

  <title>The Buck</title>

  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Not wanting to waste a glorious day, I had time for a quick activation in the morning and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-039">The Buck</a> was the recommendation.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="buck-11.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Short ascent"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/buck-11.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Short ascent"></a></p>
<figcaption>Short ascent</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The route is pretty easy, not quite a straight line as I‚Äôve drawn but I parked slightly east on the road and walked up until I met this fence line. A quick march and you can be at the top in 30 minutes. The sub-500m area is pretty boggy and wet, even today when it hasn‚Äôt rained in a while. It was a little slow in places, trying to avoid plunging my feet into ankle deep water. The path is also vague at this stage but then becomes more defined within about 1km of the summit.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>The weather was amazing, brilliant sunshine, blue skies and not a breath of wind. I was roasting on the way up!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="buck-4.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-4" title="Trig point on top of the rocky summit"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/buck-4.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Trig point on top of the rocky summit"></a></p>
<figcaption>Trig point on top of the rocky summit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Even at the top the wind was minimal, and I‚Äôve never seen my carbon-6 stand so straight at a summit before! I made use of the nice clear hole in the trig point and put the mast in it with the slim g on top. I could see for miles and miles!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="buck-6.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5" title="Setup for 2m"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/buck-6.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Setup for 2m"></a></p>
<figcaption>Setup for 2m</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I was hoping it would be a quick activation on 2m, as I needed to get back home by lunchtime, and this summit would cover a huge area. Back from his hols in <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-sota-rough-guide-to-barbados/36296">Barbados</a>, MM0EFI was first in the log. After 5 minutes, Bill in Aberdeen, GM0NRT, called back, and whilst we were talking I heard another station call. This time it was GM0UDL up in Fortrose, just north of Inverness who had seen my Lora tracker being picked up by GM4SJB (even further north!). He told me about his lora setup and how everyone around that area has setup iGates and DMR repeaters. Sounds like a great setup they have. Not long afterwards my fourth 2m contact, needed to qualify the summit, came from GM8ZKU across to the east by the coast. Again, another nice QSO with Simon for the first time. Time was getting on and I did need to be back home, I tried on more CQ but then called it a day.</p>

<figcaption>Looking North</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>had a quick look around for the <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/aberdeenshire/the-buck.shtml">ancient engravings</a> but couldn‚Äôt find them. It was a quick walk back down the hill to the car. I‚Äôd forgotten about the sogginess but managed to escape with dry feet.</p>
<p>When I got home I looked up the Lora tracking on <a href="https://lora.ham-radio-op.net/">EA2RCF‚Äôs mapping page</a>, and was surprised to see just how far away GM4SJB‚Äôs receiving igate was! It had also tracked me nearly the whole route up and down, which I then realised was me walking the county boundaries. The power on the tracker is tiny and the antenna isn‚Äôt amazing but this time it all worked well. I‚Äôve been carrying it with me on most summits but there haven‚Äôt been any igates nearby that have picked me up.</p>

</div>
<p>A nice quick 4-pointer summit - I‚Äôm beginning to think <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-018/">Morven</a> is a brutal 4-pointer! - although not for a wet day, or post a lot of rain. The summit is quite exposed, although maybe you could find some shelter depending on the wind direction. It‚Äôs a popular summit to do with Tap O‚ÄôNoth, as that‚Äôs just a few miles away, however, I just didn‚Äôt have time on this occasion. Maybe they‚Äôll be a good combo next year during the winter bonus period.</p>

  <title>FTDX10 and Omirig - for CloudlogCAT</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I‚Äôve been using <a href="https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog">Cloudlog</a> for my logs, and have also recently migrated to <a href="https://github.com/wavelog/wavelog">wavelog</a>. Both of these share the same API which you can use with various CAT command software to get data from your radio into the logging program. Most useful for when doing live QSOs and to have it update the frequency and mode for you.</p>
<p>One such tool is <a href="https://github.com/magicbug/CloudlogCAT">CloudlogCAT</a> (windows only). It uses omnirig behind the scenes to interface with the radio. Other tools can be seen on the <a href="https://github.com/wavelog/Wavelog/wiki/Third-Party-Tools">wiki</a> pages of the two loggers. I had this working on another laptop but for various reasons was using a different one. I‚Äôd setup the vertical again in the garden and brought out the FTDX10 to use. I spent ages faffing about trying to get this to work and eventually found the right settings.</p>

<p>I also have a nicer way of setting up the spiderbeam mast using a base clamp wooden block and guy wires attached to a hose clamp with rubber nitrile protecting the mast. It takes no time at all to setup, and the remote ATU, radials, cables, and radio are all critical path items now!</p>

<p>Another day off and the forecast was promising blue skies and sunshine. I‚Äôd spent the evenings this week trawling sotlas trying to figure out where to go. It was our youngest‚Äôs P1 stay and play this morning, plus swim training after school, so I had to fit my trip into that window. I‚Äôve been finding I go faster than OS Maps walking prediction but yet to keep detailed enough records to figure out my speed, so planning a new location is always hit or miss (along with the <a href="https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/">alerts</a> I post!) To complicate matters more, I was planning on cycling the first part of the route before walking. I settled on Mount Keen and left after a fun session with the P1s.</p>

<p>I was also going to go the Glen Esk route, from the south, vs.&nbsp;the Glen Tanar one from the north. I thought it was a closer drive to home, but it was actually further, however, I think the walk is shorter this way. The road into Glen Esk seems to go on and on and on! Plus no end of dumb pheasants to watch out for on the road. I‚Äôve actually done this hill before, maybe 12/13 years ago and on that trip we ended up walking through a blizzard! I can‚Äôt remember if we even made it to the top or decided to head back down, to then find the stream crossing to be more challenging than the way up!</p>

<p>I cycled from the car park, just before the Lochlee Parish Church, along the north side of the river. My bike is a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù which is more road bike than mountain bike but has thickish tyres. I think this was probably the limit for it, as it was quite rocky and the ride was very rattly! I made it, and it cut off a good chunk of time but wasn‚Äôt always pleasant. I set off at 10:45 from the car park, and cycled for 30 minutes to just before the stream crossing in the picture above. The terrain is fairly flat with only a small incline the whole way. You also pass the Queen‚Äôs Well, which is nice to look at if you‚Äôve never seen it before.</p>

<p>The path is very clear and well made the whole way, some places its been eroded by water, or repaired with big chunks of rock. The roadway keeps going and you have to make sure you turn off towards Mount Keen.</p>

<p>After an hour I‚Äôd reached the top and had my HT out as MM0VPM was on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-009">Sgor Gaoith</a> and I was hoping for a summit to summit. Seems the weather wasn‚Äôt as good with him inland, and the snow I could see in the distance was probably where he was! I heard GM4CCN calling CQ and tried to answer but the Aberdeen folk thought I was calling CQ and called me back. Made a couple of contacts on the telescopic RH770 with the new FT-65 before setting up the slim G off to the side.</p>

</div>
<p>There were quite a few folks on the summit so I was over to the west side. Not sure if that was the best as I was in the shadow of the cairn and perhaps they might‚Äôve been blocking my signal. I heard GM4CCN a few more times and we tried to have a QSO. I found holding the PTT on the FT65 difficult when my hands were getting cold, that I don‚Äôt think I was actually transmitting and so we never made the QSO. Bill, GM0NRT, kept saying I dropped out but I think it was not holding the PTT. I was probably holding it wrong, in my right hand and using my finger on the PTT, vs.&nbsp;my left and using my thumb. Or I should‚Äôve put on a glove.</p>

<p>I tried the slim G for a bit, had a couple more but not as many as I thought I‚Äôd get on this summit. I switched to HF with the 5.5m vertical and tried 20m. A good reply on 20m with 16 in the log. I did try 10m for a bit. I heard a VK station absolutely booming in, who was talking to a MW0 station in Wales, but only one reply to my CQ. By this time I was getting cold and I‚Äôd been on the summit an hour, and should probably be getting back.</p>

<p>As I was packing up a lady, who I‚Äôd passed on my bike, asked me to take a photo of her. She also asked if I was a Russian spy. I said a good spy wouldn‚Äôt reveal if they were one - but also that could be double bluffing. We ended up walking back down together until I got to my bike. She was trying to complete all the Munros, and had about 20-odd left. I thought about making my excuses and running ahead but it was nice having a little chat and she wasn‚Äôt really any slower than me.</p>
<p>The bike ride back was easier as slightly downhill, so only took 20 minutes, and I was back at the car in no time, and home with 30 minutes to spare! Although only 12% battery in the car. The journey out had used 51% of the battery, which was slightly worrying but I suspect it was the colder morning, and now it was 15 C.</p>

<p>Sunday and a busy day for the kids planned, however, it did mean my eldest and I were free all morning. She‚Äôd enjoyed our <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-068/">last SOTA activation</a> and this time I wanted to try somewhere further afield, and do more than a one-pointer! Especially after my mid-week three summits trip.</p>

<p>We drove to the Lecht ski centre through thick fog and mist (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_(fog)">haar</a>) for about an hour. I‚Äôd looked at the forecast and it was meant to be partially sunny, but I was wondering if it had changed but I‚Äôd not seen it. However, with about 20 minutes to go, it suddenly cleared up and when we reached the car park it was a lovely day. This significantly helped the trip as I‚Äôm not sure my hiking partner would‚Äôve been too pleased other wise! She immediately commented that the first path looked steep. She wasn‚Äôt wrong, it was the steepest part of the journey, although later on, on the way back, it was taxing again.</p>

<p>You walk around the lifts and towards another summit before descending and then ascending again to the final summit. Alone, and determined, I reckon I could do it in 45 minutes, but today it took us 1:15, with a couple of stops to sit down for a bit.</p>

<p>Annoyingly my Kenwood D72 wouldn‚Äôt turn on. It had died on Foudland during the week and I assumed it was just flat. I‚Äôd charged it and the charging light had turned green so I assumed all was good. Well no, it wasn‚Äôt. I tried fiddling with the battery clip to get it out but couldn‚Äôt work the mechanism and soon gave up on it. I had an old TH-79 with me which did turn on (although the LCD screen doesn‚Äôt show all the segments and is difficult to read). I have tested the TH-79 at home and it transmitted, but no-one could hear me and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was really working.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt want to spend too long faffing about as the summit is very exposed, and whilst it was a nice day, my daughter would soon get cold just sitting around. So I switched to HF. I debated between the 5.5m random wire vertical or the 40m EFHW. I wanted to go on 40m and the random wire isn‚Äôt necessarily great for 40m. However, I should‚Äôve just gone with the vertical. As I was rushing, it meant it took me ages to get setup as things kept going wrong. Eventually I was sorted, but then the challenge of finding a free frequency. Seemed to be a contest going on, bunkers on the air and all sorts, but I did manage. Got 5 on 40m, including two locals from the SOTA Whatsapp group and that meant success! I thought I‚Äôd quickly try 20m. I heard one faint German station but when I looked up the cloud had come right in and we were sat in it. I knew it was time to go, and so we quickly packed up and started heading down. A summit in the cloud is disorientating and cold.</p>

<p>We headed back down, and wanted to cut off part of the path up to the first summit, and follow the contours around. We were sort of successful but did get caught up in the bog and ended up walking a bit further downhill than we should‚Äôve. Again, the cloud level didn‚Äôt help. It was a big of a struggle to get back on to the path at the top of the ski runs but we made it, and then it was an easy downhill from there.</p>
<p>Quite the change when we got to the bottom, the nice view at the start of this post was replaced by white cloud!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm glad we arrived when we did, else it would‚Äôve been quite miserable and the only excitement of the radio activation wouldn‚Äôt have been shared by all!</p>
<p>We stopped at the Spar in <a href="https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/strathdon/bellabeg/index.html">Bellabeg</a> for some diet coke and a jam swiss roll, which we ate nearly half each before driving home.</p>
<p>There are a few more 4 pointers in the area, and hopefully I can get back to do some of those. Most have been activated less than 10 times, which suggests they‚Äôre maybe not that exciting or easy to get to. <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-023">Brown Cow Hill</a>, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-036">Geallaig</a>, and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-034">Mona Gowan</a> don‚Äôt seem too bad, so perhaps I should try those first.</p>
<p>When I got home I checked the D72. It wouldn‚Äôt turn on, but when I plugged in an external power supply it turned on and then worked fine on battery. I don‚Äôt like the reliability of this, and being caught out on a summit again. I might get a new battery pack but I also might look for another HT. Perhaps a Yeasu FT-65 etc. that has great battery life is just a simple HT.</p>

  <title>Building a portable 2m yagi</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I‚Äôve been enjoying activating SOTA summits on 2m, and after visiting <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-012/">Glas Maol</a> and seeing how far I could get with an omni directional antenna, and watching videos of people using a 2m yagi to get into England from the highlands, I wanted to build a yagi.</p>
<p>All my research pointed me towards <a href="https://www.qsl.net/dk7zb/start1.htm">DK7ZB‚Äôs</a> designs, specifically the <a href="https://www.qsl.net/dk7zb/PVC-Yagis/PVC-details.htm">lightweight ones</a>. I decided the 4 element design with a 1m boom was optimal between gain and practicalities. This has a gain of 7 dBd and a front to back ratio of 12 dB. It also has the advantage of being able to use it with 70 cms.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>I went to B&amp;Q and bought some 22mm PVC pipe, some wall clips, 4mm aluminium rods, and a 6mm aluminium tube. I already had some electrical connector blocks and RG58 cable at home. I made the boom a little longer than 1m, so I could hand hold it if I wanted to, otherwise it only needs to be 1m in length.</p>

<p><a href="https://vk1nam.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/antenna-project-portable-2m-4el-dl6wu-yagi/">VK1AD‚Äôs post</a> on building a similar yagi helped me decide how to mount everything to the boom, and I set to cutting the aluminium rods and drilling the holes in the clamp. The directors are easy, as they just slide through the clamp as a single piece. The reflector is slightly longer than 1m which the rods come in, so I used the 6mm tube as a connector between two 4mm rods. Sounds good in theory but it‚Äôs tricky to get the rods into the tube - precision hammering needed.</p>

<p>The driven element used the connectors from inside an electrical connector block, zip tied and then glued into one of the clamps. I used some solder wick to attach the coax to and screwed the elements in on each side.</p>

<p>RG58 is a bit heavy but it‚Äôs all I had so would do. Whilst this was easy to build, it does mean the only way I can transport it is by unscrewing the elements. Not the best solution but I wanted to get it built vs.&nbsp;debating over other ways or buying more things. A common way others do it is with a box mounted on the boom and there‚Äôs a coax connector on it, so you can remove the box with driven element in one. My one has about 3-4m of coax on which is enough from the mast mounting position to having the radio on the ground underneath.</p>

<p>I marked the PVC tube with sharpie for the location of each clamp, together with numbers. I also put a mark in the centre of the rod on the directors so I could centre it if it moved about in the clamp. It‚Äôs all about 1m long and I found a thin bag to carry it in. It‚Äôs not the greatest but will do. I used bungees to tie it to the side of my backpack.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm using a SOTABeams <a href="https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/tactical-mini-compact-ultra-portable-6-m-19-6-ft-mast/">tactical mini</a> mast to support it. It‚Äôs 6m telescopic fibreglass pole that has more strength than my usual <a href="https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/carbon-6-ultra-light-6-m-19-6-ft-mast/">Carbon-6</a> mast. There are two conduit wall mounts attached to the boom, so the yagi can be mounted vertically or horizontally. It works well enough, although if I want to change polarisation I have to take the mast down and then put it up again. I could take out all the other sections I don‚Äôt need but if I‚Äôm only taking one mast on an activation I want the 6m in case I need to setup HF.</p>
<p>I 3D printed some guying rings and rope tensioners from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5616644">this design</a> and cut some cord to length for the mast. The 2nd lowest ring fitted perfectly on the bottom segment of the tactical mini.</p>

<p>First test was in the garden, listening to the 2m lunchtime net‚Ä¶so it received well enough.</p>
<p>The first outing was to <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-072">Cairn William</a>, where I‚Äôd set it up on the top. We‚Äôd arranged SSB activity on another summit, although that guy had to pull out, however, we‚Äôd also prepared the locals to listen out. I started with SSB and managed to make four contacts locally with it. I then flipped it to FM and made a few more. Including a nice summit to summit with Schiehallion, around 112 km away! I brought it out later in the day on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-079">Tillymorgan</a>, and managed a contact with Helmsdale, around 100 km to the north‚Ä¶whilst the yagi was pointing south! Turning it around turned me from a 53 and a 59 by the chaser</p>

<p>I‚Äôm pleased with the results and think it worked rather well! It wasn‚Äôt too tricky to setup and use in the field, nor heavy to carry. It takes a bit of getting used to the length of it, especially when walking through forests as I kept catching it on trees and causing them to dump all their water onto my back!</p>
<p>I think a different way to connect the coax and the driven element would improve it, and maybe a dedicated mast that was just the right length would be better.</p>
<p>I did find this design for a <a href="https://www.iz2uuf.net/wp/index.php/2013/04/06/100g-yagi/">100g yagi</a> that looks nice, and have saved a few links to 2m moxon‚Äôs. Not sure when or if I‚Äôll make these, as I do like the convenience of the slim G. I also <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/754860-mast-clip-for-2m-slim-g-antenna-for-sota-use-espec">printed a clip</a> for it, so it doesn‚Äôt flap around in the breeze.</p>

<p>A quick drive across the A96 and I was parked by the old church - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pah11Z7VKxTnonEh7">Kirkton of Culsalmond Old Parish Church</a>. The path is easy, straight up the road to the turbines and then either around them bypassing the fence, or past them and then finding a spot where the barbed wire fence has come down.</p>

<p>Decided to setup the yagi again and try it out, just on FM this time. The wind blew it around a little which caused signal reports to jump up and down. Managed across the water to the North to Helmsdale, about 100 km away‚Ä¶from the back of the yagi! I was 53 at first but when I turned it around I was 59 to him.</p>

<p>Just managed four in the log but that was enough, starting to feel the days activities now and it was time to be heading home. My shoes hadn‚Äôt done well on Cairn William, and were soaked back then, and still wet now.</p>

<p>This was the first summit I tested my <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/building-a-2m-portable-yagi/">new 2m yagi</a> on. I was pleased with the summit to summit with Schiehallion around 112 km away.</p>
<p>I parked in a lay by just <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vJktHhqjE538fz6N6">here</a>, and walked up several mountain bike trails.</p>

<p>The first part was pretty muddy, but once up on the forestry track and beyond it was fine. It was a nice day if you looked south, but not so much to the north. The summit was in the clouds and somewhat damp.</p>

<p>Was fairly light breeze on the summit but nothing too bad, so it wasn‚Äôt hard setting up the mast with the guys. They do get tangled somewhat so I might look at alternatives.</p>

<p>Spoke to a couple of locals on the HT, once I was within the activation zone, and then setup the yagi for SSB. Managed 4 on sideband - a first for me - and 2M0RVZ had his first 2m sideband as well. Both of us using the ic-705. I think Chris just used the RH-770 for his antenna on the radio!</p>

<p>I let Bill, GM0NRT, know I was going up some other hills later that day, so he was going to keep an ear out for me.</p>
<p>As I was packing up I met G0JSO (although now GM0JSO as he‚Äôs moved locally) and we had a nice long chat about amateur radio. He‚Äôs not been on the air in ages and was asking lots of questions. I sent him an email when I got home, and hopefully we will hear him on the air soon. It would be good to add him to the local SOTA chat for activator and chaser‚Ä¶but will see what happens.</p>
<p>Off to the next summit!</p>

<p>Next summit of the day. A short drive up the A96 and off at Colpy to Hill of Foudland. I was approaching from the east so I was close to Tillymorgan but it‚Äôs not a very exciting route. I think there‚Äôs a better one from the east. I‚Äôd read on Walkinghighlands that there‚Äôs more <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CWsRgrzdmu87g1Ma9">parking in the forest</a>, beyond the limits of the public road. Not sure if this is really allowed or not but it seemed better than parking on essentially <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/v4MQV2DuYVNJe6as6">nothing</a>, as I was out of the way. This also saved me some walking along a boring track. After the chat with G0JSO, I was 30 minutes later than planned, and so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to make it in time to get at the summit for the lunchtime 2m net.</p>

<p>As I was walking up I had my HT tuned into 145.550 MHz listening out for them. I managed to call into the net and said I was hiking up and I‚Äôd come back to them when I was at the top. I knew the top was quite flat, and watching SOTAGoat app I saw I was within the activation zone but still a good ~650 m from the actual summit point. At this stage I setup the telescopic pole between my legs with the slim G on the top.</p>

<p>On the way up, with the RH770, Bill and Paul couldn‚Äôt hear me (nor I Paul), but once I had the slim G up on the 6m mast, everyone was a very good signal. So I had three from the net and Mike was trying break in but the other guys kept chatting! Eventually it came round to me and I was answering their questions and building up to bringing Mike in when the D72 died on me! Luckily I had the 705 and got that hooked up. I rejoined and explained, plus got Mike in. If I just had the KX2 I‚Äôd been annoyed about that one!</p>

<p>I was sat right in front of the towers but they were quiet on 145.550. I think the 705 had some issues with them but I turned off the pre-amp and that seemed to keep it calm. I said my goodbyes and turned back down the path to my third and final summit of the day!</p>

<p>After hearing that Alan, MM0VPM, was doing a <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-002-003-and-007/36165">tour of the Cairngorms</a>, the local SOTA group was listening out for him. I commented that no one had done <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-007">Beinn Bhrotain</a> for a long time, not even Fraser. His response was, ‚ÄúHow about Sunday, then?‚Äù The offer included transportation and a loan of a mountain bike, plus, of course, the guided tour‚Äîan offer too good to refuse! Free time on the weekends can be tricky, with several sets of kids‚Äô activities and potential birthday parties, so we needed to start early so I could be back in time for my wife to start her coaching session at the swim club. Fraser was good with that, and our rendezvous was at 6 a.m. in the Dinnet car park for the onward journey to the Linn of Dee.</p>

<p>We‚Äôd all seen a photo recently shared of the midge in the area, which is quite unusual away from the west of Scotland. Sure enough, there were plenty about when we arrived and unpacked the bikes. We met a DoE group packing up their tents at White Bridge, and they told tales of woe and suffering in the evening; the leader seemed very pleased to be going home. My wife later told me about one of her swimmers sending home a photo of a pan of custard he was cooking on his expedition, which had a nice layer of midges on top. ü§¢</p>

<p>The weather was pleasant enough, although the promised clear skies had yet to appear, and the cloud level was fairly low. We continued on our ride, following the Dee along a rockier track with plenty of culverts to negotiate. After around 7.5 km of cycling, we left the bikes by the side of the fence and took the track up towards the first summit we could just about see, Carn Cloich-mhuilinn. The path came and went, or we found and lost it several times, but with the rocky peak to aim for, it wasn‚Äôt too difficult to navigate. Every so often, Fraser would point out surrounding summits or features, complete with name, SOTA points, and YouTube URL, the names of which I‚Äôd immediately forget until he told them to me again on the way back down. The last 200m or so climb of this Carn was bouldery but nice underfoot, a bit like clambering across rocks at a beach. With the interim summit climbed, we admired the view. The cloud was still low, and a few patches of sun were appearing in the distance. It looked promising that it would clear for us, although I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would in time for our final ascent.</p>

<p>We had a good view across a small gully where the path was as obvious as could be. After a short descent down to a wee stream, the path was lost to us. A few phantom paths appeared, and we followed them, probably veering more towards the west than necessary, but we found a way. I kept my eye on SOTAGoat, to be sure I wasn‚Äôt being led astray, and we soon found ourselves both within the activation zone and the cloud. The trig appeared out of the mist, and we had made it!</p>

<p>Having eaten breakfast in Aberdeen at 5 a.m., it now felt like lunchtime, even though it was only around 09:15. At this point, I found out one of Fraser‚Äôs secrets to successful mountaineering ‚Äî <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttery_(bread)">butteries</a>. Claiming ‚Äúthis was all he could find in the cupboard,‚Äù he proceeded to eat what I‚Äôd estimate to be around 8,000 calories in a matter of minutes. Checking the schedule, we decided we had around 45 minutes on the summit before we should head back down.</p>
<p>Fraser had brought the FT-857 and his <a href="https://www.iz2uuf.net/wp/index.php/2013/04/06/100g-yagi/">100g yagi</a>, and was hopeful to activate on 2m. I was on HF with the KX2 and the 18ft (5.5m) random wire vertical. We each found a suitable pile of rocks to shelter behind and set to work.</p>

<p>I started on 40m; the antenna needs a transformer to get a match, and even though it‚Äôs short, I‚Äôve made contacts this way before. I thought I‚Äôd try 40m, as maybe it‚Äôs a desirable trig point or WAB etc., place that folks would want. I could hear some contest callers, but after my spot and calling with no replies, it was clearly completely dead for me, so I moved to 20m. After spotting and calling CQ, a slow trickle of replies came, and I relaxed once I crossed number 4! The replies kept coming, including four summit-to-summit stations in Germany, Switzerland, and Romania. I considered some other bands, but time was marching on, my hands were cold, and everything was getting wet. The sun suddenly shone through for a few moments, and it looked lovely. Two runners then came by, having climbed from the opposite side. They asked what I was doing, to which my usual answer is ‚Äúamateur radio, speaking to other people on mountains.‚Äù They were impressed with Switzerland and asked if I could say hi from them. They soon ran off again, and given they were in running shorts and vests, I‚Äôm not surprised they didn‚Äôt want to hang around.</p>

<p>I could hear Fraser still calling and trying to keep his wind vane under control. I got the thumbs up that he didn‚Äôt need to get on HF, so I packed up. We had a brief celebration‚Äîthis was my first 10-pointer‚Äîand then turned around and headed back down.</p>

<p>Once we were down out of the cloud, the view improved significantly! The cloud had started to lift, and we could see the surrounding summits and valleys‚Äîspectacular! Similar to the way up, paths came and went, but we had a clear view of the Dee and knew where to go.</p>

<p>Back on the bikes and back towards civilisation. We had a quick stop at the Chest of Dee waterfalls, where the pool looked lovely and inviting, before the final 5km or so to the car park. Up, activated, and back in under 6 hours.</p>
<p>Fraser did well on 2m, with an FM contact into the Yorkshire coast, 310 km away. Although, I think he would‚Äôve liked some more SSB activity.</p>

<p>Back home, and back to reality of family life. A great trip out, and thanks to Fraser for making it happen. I‚Äôve bought a lot of things since starting amateur radio, but didn‚Äôt think mountain bike shopping would next on my list! üöµ</p>

  <title>More QSL cards</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/more-qsl-cards/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A formal looking letter arrived for me this morning, when I looked closely I could see it was from Germany. Inside were some nice QSL cards.</p>
<p><a href="dk1mi.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/more-qsl-cards/dk1mi.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://dk1mi.radio/about/">Micheal</a> has two of his own from our HF SSB, HF FT8 and QO-100 QSOs over the past year, plus then the special one, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/DF0MF">DF0MF</a>, from the lightship in Emden. <a href="https://dk1mi.radio/amrumbank/">Micheal describes</a> his discovery and subsequent visit and activation of this historical ship.</p>
<p>I shall need to QSL, although Micheal‚Äôs two different cards makes me think about making a new QSL card for my portable SOTA operations. ‚õ∞Ô∏è</p>
<p>The TH-79E in the background of the photo also arrived today. The battery is dead and I have no power supply for it, and it was sold as ‚Äúseen‚Äù so let‚Äôs hope a new battery will fix it!</p>
