The [145 Alive!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/906901577214402/?locale=en_GB) event was planned for today between 1-3pm, which I wanted to join in with. Should be the perfect time to activate a summit on 2m! I had have the three little kids with me for the day, so it had to be a easy summit. Particularly, as I wanted to bring up the tent and lunch and things for them, to keep them entertained whilst I was on the air. The previous times I've brought them, I've only been about 20 minutes at most and trying to go much longer would be tricky. Eventually, I want to qualify all the GM/ES summits, and so Waughton hill is on my list. It's quite out of the way with nothing else nearby, so it's a trip in itself and for one point, I'm not wasting a day off on it! It's also the lowest summit in GM/ES, and seemed perfect for our adventure.

The path up is short, although does cross a field full of cows, and you soon find yourself by the white horse. Walk by its head and you're on the top of the rise, and heading towards the old hunter's cottage. The actual summit is a bit further away, requiring you to go down and up the side of the hill again. However, the hunter's cottage is in the activation zone and the kids thought we'd reached the top and started playing in the house. There was also a nice piece of grass without any sheep or animal droppings on it for the tent I'd brought. The tent and mast went up easily enough and lunch and various toys were unloaded into the tent. It was about 12:55 and I wanted to be on the air for the start of the event, so swallowed down my rolls and setup the IC-705.

I've not long had the IC-705 and whilst it is very simple to use, sometimes I get into some modes or settings that I don't know how to get out of. Today I was already
