After the big hill, it was time to do the small one - [Conachcraig](https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-019). It certainly looked small from Lochnagar summit but it's still a respectable 865m tall.

It felt like a short, straight up route on a nice track. I turned and looked back at Lochnagar and could see the cloud hovering over the summit, although not submerging it.

The rock formations on Conachcraig are interesting to look at, I haven’t really got a good photo of them so you’ll have to go there yourself. Unsurprisingly, no-one else was at this summit with me and I ducked down behind a rock to keep out the wind whilst I setup again on 2m.

Thanks again to Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ for their contacts on both summits, then with Simon, GM4JXP, and finally Richie, GM1LKD, in Aberdeen I was set. It was now 3:05pm, and I needed to be home by 5pm, and with an hour+ drive, it was time to pack up and head back to my bike.

The downhill bike ride back only took 20 minutes, and was a great way to end the trip. 28 km all in, and home in time!
