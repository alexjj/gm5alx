I enjoyed the snow drifts on the way down, bounding along, sinking knee deep into the snow. This was then replaced with climbing the steep side of Carn Liath (the previous summit here: [GM/ES-020](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-020)). Once up on the plateau the hike is easier, although the amount of rocks does mean you need to watch your footing.

Here Fraser and I met and compared notes, and took a selfie (most important) and then wished each other well for the next summit.

With the change in summits by 1-2 m, the new summit is further to get to and it‚Äôs easy to lose track of the number of summit cairns you count on the way! Only from the map can you tell which is highest. When the cloud opened, you were rewarded with amazing views across to Ben Avon and Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird, and looking back I could see Culadorch and somewhere Fraser climbing up to the top. Fraser and I had a little chat whilst walking, just to make sure the other was still there for the complete.

Eventually I reach the summit, or one of two cairn summit points, and get setup on HF again.

40m was still reasonable for me and I had a steady stream of QSOs. There is a little shelter behind the rocks, but the wind was much calmer so the wind chill had dropped considerably. By this time Fraser appeared on the radio again, this time at the summit, and this QSO marked the moment of both of us completing our pair of completes!

I remembered I‚Äôd offered to try 2m to the locals, and Simon [@GM4JXP](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/u/gm4jxp) and Mike [@2M0WNA](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/u/2m0wna) were both nice and clear on my Alinco and RH770.

Fraser had told me his mast had snapped at the top, supposedly from freezing between summits but also maybe from the rage of finding the plastic bottle in the trig point. 20m wasn‚Äôt great, but fortunately 2m was, and meant Fraser could qualify.

I packed up and started back towards the bikes. The wind had definitely dropped, and it was warm work walking back. Our timings worked out well, as we saw each other walking down towards to the bikes, and I arrived just a few minutes before Fraser did.

Winter woollies off; downhill racing gear on, and we headed back. It is only after hurtling down the track at 40-50 kph do you realise just how much of a climb you did on the way out. The memory was quickly returned when we hit the uphill section, complete with slowsand. We did pass a couple of older walkers, who still got a fright as we went by even though there was much bell ringing. Back through the gates and down the track towards the forest.

Whilst going down at, according to my watch, 28 kph, I tried to avoid a rock, but then my front wheel hit some smooth rock side on, and I went sideways and downways. Whilst I avoided the rock, I‚Äôd hit several others, and everything else on the ground. Remarkably limited injuries, except my nice walking trousers, and an apple in my side pocket üçéüí•, I got back on the bike. Fraser looked concerned but did comment he wish he had his GoPro on, as those videos get a lot more views. At a slightly more cautious speed, we continued down through the trees and back to the estate road. Again, greeted with some uphill sections, just to finish you off - this section is particularly painful after doing [Ben Avon and Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird](https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/).

Back to the car, loaded the bikes and after 25 km, and 5 hours round trip, Fraser wasn‚Äôt looking for some extra at the other end and I dropped him at his house. Home for a nice cup of tea before back in the car again.

A good proper winter outing, and two more GM/ES off my list, thanks Fraser! üíØ
