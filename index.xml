  <title>Cairngorms National Park SOTA Summits</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2025/sota-summits-in-the-cairngorms/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Cairngorms park is a pretty big place. You tend to think of just the mountains in the middle but it covers around 4,500 km^2 or nearly 1,750 sq miles. It has a <a href="https://cairngorms.co.uk/">dedicated website</a> with lots of information if you’re interested.</p>
<p>Whilst I’m trying to activate and qualify all 87 GM/ES sota summits, I also wondered about all the summits within the Cairngorms. This extends into CS and WS. Using a <a href="https://cartographyvectors.com/map/1359-cairngorms-national-park">Cairngorms GeoJSON file</a>, and the summit lists from the <a href="https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/association/GM">sota database</a> I was able to find those within the park.</p>
<p>I think there are 82 summits: 44 in ES, 36 in CS, and 2 in WS. Below is a map to explore and also a list. <a href="cairngorms_summits.csv">Here’s a CSV of them</a>.</p>
<p>I think a fun project would be to make a Cairngorms activator award, for those who activate every summit in the Cairngorms.</p>

<p>We were staying nearby with family for Christmas and I’d been looking on the map at the summits near their house. Quite a few good ones and many are hardly activated. The weather hadn’t been great over the Christmas period, mostly wet, either raining or just very damp - although it always seems wet here but maybe that’s just because I live on the east coast. If it was nicer we would’ve all gone up Conic Hill (<a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-239">GM/SS-239</a>) during the week. The family were off to Moana 2, and I was given the option of coming or not…! I thought about the two 2 pointers nearby, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-117">Beinn Uird</a> and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-124">Binnean nan gobhar</a>. The latter having not been activated since 2016! They’re like GM/ES summits with only 7 and 6 activations. It would’ve given me 10 points and probably taken the same amount of time. However, the draw of another Munro - the most southerly one - was too much and those two summits are maybe better with the kids in the future.</p>

<p>It was just 20 minutes to Rowardennan where the Ben Lomond car park is, and for £5 you can stay all day. I dread to think what this is like in the height of summer, as the car park is tiny and it was quite full on a miserable December day. There is overflow parking further away which you pass on the road in. The route is straight forward and well marked. There’s even a water bottle refill station!</p>

<p>I took the eastern route up to the top, and the path is very good nearly the entire way, with just a few small sections of walking up rock face. I met quite a few folk coming down and overtook several going up. Not sure all of them were well prepared… A group of young individuals from Glasgow stopped and had a brief chat with me. Whilst they’d come down from the summit, they were still pretty high! 🚬🌿</p>

<p>It’s quite a hike vertically, from sea level to 974m, although most is at a nice gradient. The views were non-existent, and maybe around 500 m I was in the cloud. It wasn’t raining though, so that was a plus. Pretty much after 2 hours I reached the top.</p>

<p>There’s a nice grassy part to the NE of the summit which drops away and helps you keep out the wind. I setup my carbon 6 with slim g there and called on 2m. Two guys and a boy, who I’d passed on the way up, came over when they heard the radio but quickly dismissed me once they saw. 2m was lively and I had several mobile stations in their cars, and then a summit to summit with Andy, MM7MOX, over on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-209">Broomy Law</a>. After a run of 8, I called CQ a few more times but no replies. I thought about HF but I was actually soaking wet as the water was condensing on me from the clouds, and so I decided not to bother and just head back. I wanted to do the loop and so looked around for the path down on the other side.</p>

<p>The pictures don’t do it justice, but it’s quite a steep and rocky route on this side just past the summit. In fact this way is much more adventurous than the side I took up. I think if anyone is uncertain or with kids, then I’d suggest going up and down the eastern route only. Probably climbing up the western side is better than going down. The route was fine on the way down, again, no views for much of the way, until maybe around 400m when I came out of the clouds and they’d cleared a little on the Loch.</p>

<p>We were driving down to family for Christmas, and needed to take two cars. I was in the electric and on my own. Managed to make it to Perth to the fast chargers there and assumed I’d be having lunch on my own whilst the others went out when they arrived. I had thought of doing <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-192">Craigowl Hill</a> on the way down but decided it wasn’t worth it as it was raining on the way past. Plus I’m not sure I would’ve had enough charge for the detour. Whilst charging I looked at sotlas and decided I’d do Stronend as I drove by. It has a reasonable walk in, estimated at 1.5 hours, but I thought I could shave a bit of time off that. It was very convenient browsing the summits on <a href="https://sotl.as/">sotlas</a> and then downloading someone’s GPS track and opening it in OS Maps.</p>

<p>The route follows a farm track for quite a while, you go back on yourself from the layby parking, up to the farm, and then along the track. It takes you up between the two hills, and then across a stream and on towards the summit. The track is decent at the bottom but the higher you go the wetter it seems to get!</p>

<p>My boots were pretty soaked as I squelched along. It wasn’t raining but the air was damp and the cloud was low, so not much of a view. The path is pretty clear the whole way to the summit, although with a few forks that I had to check the map to make sure I was taking the right one. The summit cairn came into sight and I was pleased to have reach the top.</p>

<p>It has a nice cairn at the top, offering plenty of shelter from the wind. There’s a trig point that is covered, or maybe built?, with cobbles. Conveniently the top was open and so I used that for my mast support. I setup the slim G for 2m, spotted and called CQ. Not quite a HF pile up but several folks returned my call at once, and in about 2 minutes I had five in the log and was satisfied. Given it was now 2pm, I thought I’d better make a move and packed up. I jogged down most of the way to try and make up some time. I was soon back to the main track, however, it felt slow going to get back to the car. I was pretty soaked, my boots aren’t particularly waterproof, and the dampness had seeped into my top layers. I got changed and then headed to the house.</p>

<p>The second hill of today, which is just across the River Don from the first. I was taking the route up from Littlewood house, parking in a layby on the road by the Don. I didn’t like walking along the road so I cut through the trees to join the road up to the big house. It was a bit wet and probably only saved 2 minutes, so perhaps not worthwhile!</p>

<p>You walk past the house and then past various outbuildings until you join a land rover track up the hill. At this point I could hear a lot of shooting going on across the other side of the estate. I was slightly concerned that I would be stopped and told to go back but it seemed I was heading in the opposite direction and should be fine. Once I got past the trees and and heading up the hill I was well away from it all. You never know with shoots going on what to expect, and generally should stay away, but there were no signs or barriers. Often when going to the big hills, the places put up barriers or tell you to stick to the paths. Probably, as this was a smaller estate, and most likely don’t have very much walker traffic, don’t bother with that. By the time I got past the trees the shooting had stopped and there was a lot of car activity as I guess they were heading back for lunch.</p>

<p>The path continues up the hill and you can see the trig and summit cairn. The trig is a little exposed, so after having a look at it and trying 2m, I went over to the cairn. This is a substantial one, which you can hide in, although it seems to trap cold air and felt chilly and damp inside, so I setup on the leeward side of the cairn out of the wind. I jammed the mast into the rocks and setup the vertical for 20m. After 10 minutes or so the mast moved and started to fall, so I sat with my back against it to hold it up. 20m was very lively, with strong signals into Wales and England and good into Europe. I even had a east coast US come back as 55.</p>

<p>I packed up and headed back down to the car. I was home an hour ahead of my schedule, which was good to then have a cup of tea before collecting everyone from school for Christmas holidays! 🎅</p>

<p>This is the last day of school before the Christmas holidays and I wanted to try and fit in two 5 (with winter bonus) point summits. My spreadsheet timetable suggested there wasn’t quite enough time to fit in both, but I knew I could jog down the hills to save time and I didn’t typically use all the 45 minutes I allocated to being on the radio. First up was Coiliochbhar. There’s the route I took from the west and also another from the south. My route follows a land rover track much of the way up until you get to a big gate. This is where the estate owner is trying to encourage pheasants for shooting, and makes you take a detour around it. The path around isn’t very well developed, so a bit of heather bashing at times.</p>

<p>At the top, there’s a cairn to your left and a fence line that leads into some trees. After a look at the cairn, I got the HT out and tried 2m. It was nice to get the WhatsApp group on 2m as I walked towards the trees. It was only three so I had to setup on HF, but that was fine. I setup in the trees, offering shelter from the wind but also making for easy mast support, and setup for 40m.</p>

<p>I had a summit to summit with a German ham, and a nice run on 40m. It did start to rain, so I packed up and headed down. On the way I met a game keeper, who asked if I could avoid visiting outside of Feb-Aug due to the pheasants. I guess I’ll leave it until Feburary before I come back again - and perhaps take the southern route too to avoid the pheasant breeding area. It was a short 10 minute drive up to the main road ready for the next one!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theradiorover">Fraser</a> was off today and asked if I was around for a summit. I managed to rearrange work things so I could go out in the morning and catch up later. The forecast was showing strong winds and potentially rain. Luckily the rain never really happened, but boy, was the wind strong!</p>

<p>It’s a nice route through the forest and then along the top with good views across to Lochnagar. It took us about 1:15 to get to the summit. The final summit has two peaks, one with a cairn and one without. The wind was so strong here that we stuck at the cairn site. I setup down the leeway slope out of the wind a little.</p>
<p>I’d managed to leave my phone in my car, and so had to get Fraser to spot. This also meant no photos of the trip…Guess I’ll have to go back again! I also had to use paper logging for the first time, but managed okay!</p>

<p>Fraser setup at the cairn and was on 40m. We didn’t stay that long and soon got off the summit. We did check out the other side and the wind was insane over there, I could hardly stand and if I’d taken out my bothy bag I reckon I could’ve taken off. We headed back down and then into Ballater for a second breakfast.</p>
<p>Fraser has done a nice write up of our trip on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-twin-peaks-and-a-gale/37019">reflector</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been eyeing Hunt Hill, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-042">GM/ES-042</a>, for a while, but wanted a relatively calm day, as judging from previous reports and the internet, there isn’t much shelter on the summit. It’s also on my list of summits I can do when I have to do both school drop off and pick up. I decided to take the normal (<a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-thrill-of-the-hunt/30925">not stupid?</a> - again, relative! 🧑‍🔬) route from Glen Esk.</p>

<p>I had my bike and would cycle to the footbridge over the Lee, then head straight up and across to the summit. For my return, I wanted to see the waterfalls and so walk down to the Falls of Damff and then follow the water and path back to the bike - easy!</p>

<p>It was glorious sunshine and blue skies in Aberdeen and all the way there…until about 3 miles from the car park, when the cloud or fog came in. I was optimistic that the summit would still be in the sun and this was just some valley mist.</p>

<p>The cycle is along a nice track and relatively flat the whole way. Whilst the scenery was stunning, you can still enjoy it on a bike and save a lot of time! I dumped the bike in the heather just before the footbridge. The ground before and after the bridge was sheet ice, so some careful maneuvering to get on and off the bridge was required!</p>

<p>It’s a balance of taking a longer route and going further away from the summit, but gentler gradient and trying to take a shortcut but end up facing more and more vertical sections. No surprises what route I tried.</p>

<p>As I climbed higher the amount of snow increased, and in places it covered large sections of the hillside. It did mean the peat hags were filled in with snow and I could skip across them. Interestingly most of the snow was on the southern side of the hill.</p>

<p>As required under the obligations of climbing GM/ES, Fraser MM0EFI, was looking for a complete, and so we were hopeful on 2m. He was working but that doesn’t usually stop him from nipping out for a quick QSO. I’d alerted for 11:30am and needed to be on time, so that Fraser could serve the real workers of Westhill their christmas dinner. I was ready by 11:30 but Fraser was busy, so I admired the view whilst eating my chicken roll.</p>

<p>Fraser let me know he was on his way, and I just put out a call and we managed to work whilst he was still in the car park! I did call further on 2m but all quiet. So I switch to HF. There was a slight breeze on the summit, and the air was cold, so I wasted some time wandering about seeing if there was a better spot that offered a bit of shelter. I decided there wasn’t and just got on with it. I setup for 40m, spotted and called CQ. It took a few goes calling CQ before anyone replied. Recently there are already several stations waiting after I do my first call. However, the chasers soon started and I had a nice steady stream, offering the chance for a quick chat beyond the usual RST and thanks. I think the surrounding beauty reflected in my voice as several commented on how cheerful I was. Or something like that.</p>

<p>10 minutes on the air and after the faffing about at the start, I was running short on time, and decided not to try chasing summits and pack up, and continue my route. This didn’t start well as I proceeded to march off in the completely wrong direction as I’d “seen the stream” and knew where to go. I had seen a stream but it was the Burn of Damff to the west, rather than the falls to the south. I wasn’t too far off and reoriented back the right way.</p>
<p><a href="hunthill-11.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-16"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-042/hunthill-11.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>A classic cause of issues at work is “time pressure”, people making bad choices because they are or think they are short on time. That was me and the thought of school pick up in a few hours time.</p>

<p>I’m not stupid. I’ll take a shortcut.</p>

<p>I could see and hear the waterfalls below and without looking at any map decided I could join the path from here. Perhaps I should’ve taken advice from <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-042-hunt-hill-12th-september-2018/18687">others before me 4</a>…</p>

<p>It was tricky to take photos of the route to demonstrate just how silly it was, partially as I was using my hands to hold trees, clumps of grass or rock faces as I scrambled down the side.</p>
<p><a href="hunthill-7.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-19"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-042/hunthill-7.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>There was one moment where I came to a dead end, and the only way to go was edge past a huge boulder on about 20 cm of grass above a 5-6m drop. Of course it wasn’t the only way, I could go back the way I came but you know…tick tock tick tock ⌚👀. In this moment the wise words of my wife came into my head, and I, too, thought “this is stupid”. 🤦</p>
<p><a href="hunthill-4.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-21"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-042/hunthill-4.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>I pressed on and made it 😅 and soon reached the path by the water. The small streams running off the hill top made some impressive icicles on the rock faces, and the waterfalls were impressive and loud!</p>

<p>Back to the bike through a very chilly gully. I met another hiker admiring the views at the footbridge and he shared some of his adventures over the years in the area.</p>

<p>The cycle back was speedy, it’s slightly downhill the whole way, and home with enough time for a cup of tea before the school bell rings!</p>

<p>We were up in Inverness for a swimming competition and I wondered if there were any summits I could manage. Luckily this one is only about 15 minutes from the pool and a fairly short walk up to the top. I dropped off for warm up and then headed up the hill. I’d read it was a bit of a soggy climb, and after the storm the past few days, there was a lot of water around. The path was more like a stream and in places there was deep standing water. It really only got better when climbing to the final top.</p>

<p>The final section of the walk doesn’t really have a path up to the summit, the track just continues around the hill and away, so it was a case of scrambling up the heather and trying to avoid the streams coming down. It was cold but still on the way up, but as soon as I was on the summit the wind was strong. I found a low spot with a post and some shelter and setup on 20m there. As I wanted to be quick, I was going for the 5.5m vertical with counterpoises.</p>

<p>Not too busy on 20m, but enough in the log with 9 QSOs. I packed up and headed down the way I came and back to Inverness.</p>
<p>Some good views of the hills from the summit and from the parking area. I’ll come back next time I’m in the area, particularly if it’s during winter bonus!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In my wisdom to save walking 200m down the road to the start of the track, I decided to just head straight up the hill. Well this turned into a very wet affair, and I gradually made my way across to the path, like I should’ve from the start.</p>

<p>Some SSE folks were up doing things on the mast. They’d come up in their 8 wheeled buggy, some kind of Argocat. They were finishing up as I was looking at the trig and other features. They gave me a cheerful wave as they tootled past to go down the hill.</p>

<p>Lots of fences and rocks and all sorts to setup on the top. I decided to the south of the main mast by the fence would be good. As I had no guys, I needed something decent to strap the mast to, and setup on 40m. I had a quick QSO with Gerald again, who was on his way down, and I wanted to make this quick as it had started raining and the cold wind wasn’t enjoyable. Not as busy on the band as Monday but enough.</p>

<p>Packed up and headed back down to the car. I’d hoped Gerald and I could’ve found a nice cafe or bar to say hello, but there aren’t many options in the area. In fact, none as far as I could tell. There is the Glenisla Hotel, although that seems to shut its bar/cafe out of season on non-Friday/weekend days. So I waited by the car for Gerald to come by. We had a little chat and nice to put a face to a voice! Then off back home.</p>
<p>It’s a nice area with lots of good hills in close proximity. It would make for a good group SOTA outing - perhaps doing two hills each and rotating around, then back to the hotel bar for a celebration afterwards.</p>
<p>Now I’ve got to try and get back down there to Crock, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-056">GM/ES-056</a>, Hare Cairn, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-063">GM/ES-063</a>, Corwharn, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-048">GM/ES-048</a>, and maybe even Cat Law, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-044">GM/ES-044</a>, before the winter bonus period ends!</p>

<p>After quite the adventure on <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-040">G</a><a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/">M/ES-040</a>, and reports from Fraser as he drove down of Glenshee being quite the white, we were wondering what might be in store. Again, a look at the snow gate cameras showed us it had all gone! The Glenshee camera shows you the side of Ben Gulabin. Gerald was heading up Corwharn, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-048">GM/ES-048</a>, and I on Ben Gulabin. Somewhere between Mount Blair and Gulabin the quickest route from west Aberdeen flips from via the A90 to the A93, and so I drove the scenic route. The route up Gulabin is another straight forward one. Park off the road by the start and follow the path up.</p>
<p><a href="gulabin-12.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-077/gulabin-12.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>There’s a bit of a stream to cross, and then quite a boggy area once you turn left off the track up to the summit. Probably made worse by the just recent snow melt.</p>
<p><a href="gulabin-8.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-077/gulabin-8.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>What started as another lovely morning, had started to turn a little. The wind was cold and the clouds were creeping in. It was still nice enough on Ben Gulabin but this would be the best of the day.</p>
<p><a href="gulabin-3.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-6"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-077/gulabin-3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I came to setup on 2m, and found I’d left my guys at home. This was even more annoying as they were in my bag from yesterday, and I’d gone through everything this morning before leaving and obviously left them on the garage floor. So I held the mast and carried on. It didn’t take too long to get four, and then speak with Gerald on his summit. His phone hadn’t been charging properly and so was dead, which meant he couldn’t spot. However, he shared his info and I could spot for him on 2m SSB, which worked out well. After that I packed up and headed back to the car and drive round to the start of Mount Blair.</p>

<p>Fraser shared last night that the snow gates were shut due to the snow. When the sun came up this morning, it was a glorious sunny, crisp, cold day with amazing views of the hills. At 8:30am when I was about to leave the gates were still shut…I was going with a work friend up the hill and he felt confident the gates would be opened by 10. After passing endless signs telling me the road was closed, and finally at 10:15 am when I arrived at Cock Bridge…they were still shut. My friend was about 15 minutes behind me, and so I waited for him by Corgarff Castle.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-28.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-28.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I’d looked at an alternative route to the summit from here, in case the gates were closed. It is possible but it’s twice as far, at around 18.5 km <em>each way</em>.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-27.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-27.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>This was too far for my friend and if I was going to do it, he’d maybe only come part way. I was also trying to calculate how long we’d be and if I’d get back home in time for birthday tea with the family! As we were chatting we heard a loud rumbling of a gritter coming along the road. We watched him go up past the trees to where the gate is…road noise stops…engine quietens…CLANG! of metal against metal… that would be the gates being opened! So we headed back and got to the snow gates and sure enough he’d opened them and was heading up. He gave us the thumbs up and we followed.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-23.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-23.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>Once he opened the gates at the ski centre we were off to Tomintoul. We parked in the village opposite the hotel, rather than the parking on the route, mostly to be certain we could drive in and out again, and got ready to roll. At 9.9 km each way, this was a much more reasonable distance, and on a good day (i.e.&nbsp;not today) would probably only take about an hour to 1:15hrs to ride.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-26.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-4"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-26.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>The track down to the bridge (around 5 km) was absolutely treacherous with ice and in some places was just sheet ice across the whole track. I only fell off once and somehow managed to do a magic trick of falling onto my feet in a standing position as the bike slid out from under me and away down the road. We dropped our seats, put out our feet as stablisers and skated down some parts of it. The track is also quite undulating and several ups and downs to make you groan.</p>
<p>I just happened to check my phone and saw Fraser had spotted. We were down in the valley by the river and I didn’t expect much luck (although I was getting phone signal of course), and put out a call to him. He was in a QSO with GM0HLV but then we made contact. Chris was setting up but we kept going and when I checked later I’d missed him.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-18.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-18.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>The bridge across the river wasn’t much better, probably made worse by the fact cold air can get under as well as above it, but we made it over okay. We met some coos at the remote Wester Gaulrig Cottage, and at this point had probably been going for about 50 minutes.</p>

<p>We were past half way but still plenty to go, and now the steeper parts of the route were upon us. We could see the summit in the distance, and partially doubted that it was correct as “it seemed so far away”. We were correct, it was the summit!</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-13.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-8"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-13.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I dumped my bike at the base of the final ascent, but my friend Mike, on his ebike, gave it a shot to get to the top. The snow had drifted much more here and snow pattern told tales of strong winds. The cloud was coming in now and the good views across to Ben Avon and surroundings had gone, with only huge clouds looming over the distant high summits.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-16.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-9"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-16.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>We made it at 12:30, 1.5 hours after leaving Tomintoul, and much later than my alert. Fraser and Chris were just back at their landys for my first two QSOs on Cnap Chaochan Aitinn. I called a few more times on 2m but didn’t have any luck. I wasn’t that patient with it though and chose not to setup the slim g but just go straight to 40m … I’d come all this way, I couldn’t leave without the 40 on 40 on 40! The wind was brutal and oh so cold. We did have some equipment that we could hide behind, and took some shelter there whilst I tried to setup on 40m.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-5.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-10"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-5.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-6.jpg" class="img-fluid">I’m sure I could’ve used the small towers there to my benefit, but I was also wary of the wind turbine and getting wire caught in it, so I setup my mast down wind of it, trying to keep it close enough so I could operate from the shelter. Typically, as soon as I spotted and called CQ once the mast moved, then fell. It was tricky finding ground to get the pegs in for the guys…so I recruited another guy to hold the mast whilst he ate his super noodles!</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-12.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-11"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-12.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>I managed 6 on 40m, including a very nice summit to summit with Colin, M1BUU, as above, before I had to call QRT on the pile up. It was just too cold in the wind, even in the “shelter”. Quickly packed up and whilst admiring the views I realised the wind turbine noise had stopped and there was, in fact, no wind whatsoever! I got the HT back out and messaged Dave, MM7HMA, a local who’s just past his test and was keen to get some QSOs, and we had a nice chat. The stillness didn’t last and the return of the wind reminded us it was time to head back.</p>

<p>Back to the bike - still there 😅- and back to the car. It’s mostly downhill, but still a few steep climbs as the path goes up and down. The temperature had come up a little, and a fair amount of ice had melted so the journey was less hazardous. I was back home in plenty of time.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-9.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-16"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-9.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>Not quite the S2S action hoped for, but still a successful trip and good day out! 🎂Plus one more complete for Fraser 😅</p>
<p>I think no-one comes here as there are other summits in the area you’d do first, but the fact you can cycle right to the top does make it quite a unique one, plus with plenty of refreshment options in Tomintoul for afterwards!</p>

<p>Off to the park on the patch of dirt outside the gate into the forest and then up the track. Again, an easy route to follow although the climb up to the summit along the wall, whilst sheltered, is just heather and quite steep in places. Another summit benefitting from a nice wall to shelter behind, I setup again on HF and this time tried 20m.</p>
<p><a href="meallmor-9.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-058/meallmor-9.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>I had a big pile up on 20m, and whilst I wanted to be packing up at 3pm, I kept saying “QRZ?”! It did eventually die down about 10 past, and I packed up and headed down. The setting sun cast a strange light over the land - my phone camera doesn’t do it justice.</p>

<p>A bit further to drive this time to the start of Mealna Letter, but plenty of space to park by the path entrance into the woods.</p>
<p><a href="mealna-11.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-043/mealna-11.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-043/mealna-10.jpg" class="img-fluid">The track up is straight forward, just follow the track. When you come out of the trees, then the path disappears and you just make your way up the hill. It’s hard to go wrong as you’re aiming for the junction of the walls on the top of the first hill.</p>
<p><a href="mealna-9.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-043/mealna-9.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>You then follow the wall along the top until you get to the summit. If you’re lucky the wall can be a wind break and makes it a pleasant walk. The summit cairn is away from the wall, and is worth visiting as it offers some nice views down to the loch below.</p>
<p><a href="mealna-6.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-043/mealna-6.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>The sky was still clear and offered stunning views all around.</p>
<p><a href="mealna-5.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-7"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-043/mealna-5.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>After two summits on VHF, I thought I’d try HF, particularly with the nice wall to shelter behind, and so setup for 40m.</p>
<p><a href="mealna-1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-8"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-043/mealna-1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I had a nice run on 40m, and start chasing summits on other bands. By this time it was 1:30pm and I was 1:30 ahead of schedule. I was starting to debate if I had enough time for a fourth! Ideally, I wanted to be leaving the area at 3:30pm to get home by 5, so if I could run back to the car by 2pm, then I’d have time…not for Mount Blair but for it’s neighbour, Meall Mor, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-058">GM/ES-058</a>. Time for one <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-058/">Meall Mor!</a></p>

<p>A short drive back down the road, and parking on the verge before the roadway entrance across the river, I was off on the next summit. This route isn’t the greatest, and was only picked for it’s short duration and short drive to the starting point. It starts out easy enough following the track and then crossing the field. It briefly follows a path that you could take the whole way up to the top, just a little longer. You have to jump the Fergus Burn, but it’s quite small in places, and then you start the slog straight up the hill to the summit.</p>

<p>After the sleeting on the way down from Monamenach, the sky was even clearer now, and I had good views back and forwards of my hills for the day.</p>
<p>Whilst the walk up was steep enough, it went by quickly and I was soon leaning into the wind on the summit. There wasn’t much shelter by the trig point, and the top hole was covered, but I did find the mast mount which happened to be behind a slight rise, so that offered as little relief. Making full use of the post, I felt very smart when I took this photo.</p>

<p>At that moment it was very obvious that I should’ve attached the mast on the leeward side of the support, so the metal post didn’t act like my leg when I break sticks over it. 🤦</p>

<p>I collapsed the mast enough to get past the break and continued on 2m. Three repeat stations from the first summit, and another got it qualified and then I was “happy” to pack up and grump down the hillside back to the car. Luckily, I had packed a spare mast in the car.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been planning on doing the “four Folda fours”, specifically Mount Blair, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-035">GM/ES-035</a>, Mealna Letter, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-043">GM/ES-043</a>, Monamenach, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-028">GM/ES-028</a> and Badandun Hill, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-037">GM/ES-037</a>. However, I couldn’t find a route that I could walk the lot in one day, certainly not one December day in the light. I did find that I could chain together four individual walks and drive between the starting points. But I wasn’t sure if I could fit it all in, leaving home at 7am and being back by 5pm. So I settled on multiple visits. Plus Gerald, G4OIG, was going to be visiting at the end of the week and doing some of the summits in the area and I thought it would be nice to meet in person, as well as a chance for 2m S2Ss, so I’d want to return on the Thursday.</p>

<p>For the Monday, I’d decided on Monamenach, Badandun Hill and then Mealna Letter, and then the Thursday I’d do Ben Gulabin, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/CS-077">GM/CS-077</a>, then Mount Blair. Interestingly the last person on Ben Gulabin was Gerald, almost exactly a year ago! This would let me have a S2S with Gerald and then meet him at the bottom of Mount Blair afterwards.</p>
<p>As Gerald was visiting, we knew the weather would be bad. It was forecast to snow overnight, and I was concerned about the roads, but looking on the <a href="https://www.snowgatecameras.co.uk/">snow gate cameras</a> in the morning, it seemed like it was okay. I set off just after 7am, to arrive around 8:40am. First stop was Monamenach, the highest of the group.</p>

<p>It was a nice clear day, although chilly and windy - particularly on the summits - and brisk walk up from parking by the river, soon got me to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>Whilst there are a lot of handy posts at the summit, there was no shelter and it was blowing an icy gale. I followed the fence line down a little, and found a rock to hide behind. I setup on 2m and called my first CQ of the morning. It wasn’t too long and I had 4 contacts across Edinburgh and Glasgow. Fraser and others tried calling and listening back in Aberdeen area, but no luck. It started to sleet and I still had two more to go, so time to return to the car.</p>

<p>A Friday off and time to find a summit. Weather hasn’t been great but looked mild today, although could be windy. Mona Gowan is a straight forward 4-pointer which has a few routes up to it. I chose the most direct from the west, off the Old Military road. I’d driven 20 minutes and some flags flapping in the breeze reminded me I’d forgotten to pack my mast! I decided it was best to return home and get the mast. Although the summit has a large cairn and I could’ve tried laying the wire over it.</p>
<p>The route is straight forward, just follow the fence line and eventually you’ll see the cairn on the left. There’s a reasonable valley to across before getting to the summit, so there’s uphill on the way back too!</p>
<p>The wind was surprisingly calm when I reached the top and I set up on 2m and 40m. Things were going well but then the wind picked up and it managed to cause the wire to come off the end of the mast and I suddenly saw the SWR maxing out the scale. Decided to call it a day and head home.</p>

  <title>Calibrating the KX2 by ear</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/calibrating-kx2-by-ear/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>On my last <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-011/">SOTA activiation</a>, a couple of reports said I was off-frequency. At the weekend I setup the KX2 in the garden and arranged for a <a href="https://dk1mi.radio/">friend</a> to listen to me and see if I was really off-frequency or if I’d somehow managed to knock the VFO or turn on XIT etc. on the mountain top and not realise.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="kx2-cal-3.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Calibration setting"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/calibrating-kx2-by-ear/kx2-cal-3.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Calibration setting"></a></p>
<figcaption>Calibration setting</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We had a QSO and he recorded me a few times, once “normally” with the KX2, once with XIT on and then again using the G90. This was very helpful as I could hear my voice was a little high normally, and so I needed to XIT down. I’d guessed at 0.5 MHz but that was slightly too much. The G90 QSO was a nice benchmark as well. Whilst I was swapping to the G90 a US station called Micheal and he ended up talking to him for a while! It was Micheal who then suggested that as I’ve got two radios I can just use them to test myself, without having to deal with propagation and everything else!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="calibration.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2" title="Calibration instructions"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/calibrating-kx2-by-ear/calibration.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Calibration instructions"></a></p>

</div>
<p>The KX2 manual details what needs to be done to calibrate the radio. It’s fairly straight forward to do, but you need a reference frequency in order to calibrate it. This can either be from a signal generator or a known accurate broadcast. A well known one is <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/time-distribution/radio-station-wwv">WWV</a>, the time station from America, which broadcasts on 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 MHz. It announces the time and has a nice carrier to lock onto. I tried listening for WWV but had no luck on any bands. I did think I heard a carrier on 10 MHz and tried to use it to calibrate the radio but that put me wildly off.</p>
<p>However, all is not lost, as you can just manually adjust the reference frequency on the radio via the VFO dial, and that’s where listening to my own voice is beneficial.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="kx2-cal-1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3" title="Checking the bands"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/calibrating-kx2-by-ear/kx2-cal-1.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Checking the bands"></a></p>
<figcaption>Checking the bands</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It’s pretty straight forward to do, you put a dummy load on the transceiver you want to transmit from and I just had some wire plugged into the other. Perhaps they’ll both work with dummy loads, or perhaps even no antenna on the receiving station! I found that 40m was fine but 20m and higher frequencies were off by 0.3-0.4 MHz. So I iterated back and forth between changing the reference calibration frequency and then testing my audio again. After a few attempts I was pretty happy and everything sounded good to me.</p>
<p>In the end I went from 24,999,380 to 24,999,440. I’ve yet to try it on the air but my tests sounded good to me. I think if I wanted to improve the accuracy, I’d used CW and then I could lock onto the signal. I might still do that but for now my “by ear” will do.</p>

<p>Continuing my journey from <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-005/">Beinn Mheadoin</a>…</p>
<p>It was pretty much downhill and then back up. It was now about 1230 and I was a little behind schedule, but enjoying the sun and rainbows. I looked back over to Mheadoin and, typically, now it was in the sun too!</p>

<p>The climb up Beinn a’Chaorainn starts quite steep with loose gravel but soon turns into a nice climb, aside from the boulder patch, but you can mostly work around it. As I got higher the wind picked up again. The summit cairn didn’t look very impressive, but actually offered decent shelter and I was quite comfortable behind it.</p>

<p>This time I tried 20m and the band was much more enjoyable, with a strong signal everywhere between south of England and Greece around 1,700 miles away.</p>
<p>Denis, MM0CBC on holiday from Wales, was on his way up Ben Tinnes, GM/ES-021, and by the time I was done with HF he was just setting up there, so we had a nice 2m S2S.</p>
<p>It was 1345 and I really needed to be back at Linn of Dee by 1530, to get home in time, so after getting distracted taking more photos, I hot stepped it back down and retrieved my bike. A reasonable number of other cyclists and hikers out, I didn’t meet any on the summits but along the main routes. It seemed now was the best weather of the day and plnety to enjoy as I cycled back.</p>

<p>Back at Linn of Dee at exactly 1530, and then the 1.5 hours drive back to Aberdeen. There was a huge moon and the road back to Braemar offered some lovely views of the moon between the trees and hills, together with the start of the sunsetting, my potato photo doesn’t do it justice.</p>

<p>Another big trip, probably the last of this year, unless there’s a December heat wave, and two infrequently visited and activated summits. It’s hard not to be biased by the weather but Beinn a’Chaorainn was my favourite today. When the clouds cleared I could see over to Beinn a’Bhuird area, down to Beinn Bhreac and big sweeping expanses of hillsides. It would’ve been nice to have been on Beinn Mheadhoin when the cloud lifted to see across to the west, and probably that would’ve been more spectacular. I’ll be revisiting them both next year, hopefully finding a day with clear blue skies! 🌞</p>

<p>The weather has been lovely up here all week - next week, however less so…</p>

<p>So I wanted to make the most of it, and took today off. Monday or Tuesday were better days but alas I couldn’t make that happen. As you can see the forecast was meant to be lovely clear skies and maybe some cloud creeping in later. Well it was the opposite, with the best weather as I was cycling back…oh well. Here we go:</p>

<p>Last week I did <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-001/">GM/ES-001</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-013/">GM/ES-013</a> on a big bike and hike, and today would be similar. I had debated between Cairn Toul + Braeriach and the two summits today, but everyone told me Cairn Toul circuit was too much, and save that for a summer’s day (or maybe camp in the Corrour bothy at the bottom). They’d all done the route so I should probably listen…and eventually I did. I’m glad, because it would’ve been too long, and the weather wasn’t the best - particularly the wind - and so that wouldn’t have been enjoyable.</p>

<p>Starting at Linn of Dee car park, around 0830, I cycled on the nice track to Derry Lodge. Here my route would take me east following the Derry Burn up Glen Derry. This section of the track is not great for cycling on, lots of roots, rocks, narrow sections with overhanging heather. It was slow going, much slower than I planned. Once you get to the next bridge and a few 10s metres along it’s much better. Some maps show an ATV track that runs somewhat parallel to this route. I didn’t see the start of it, but wondered if it would be better. Near the bridge you see it, and I did try it on the way back but it was very boggy, muddy and wet, and quick to disappear, so I just stuck to what I knew. The return run is less bad, as at least you’re generally going downhill.</p>

<p>The cycling continues along the track, and once you pass the final wooded area it starts to become rocky and difficult again. I started pushing my bike through the bad sections but they just became more and more, and it wouldn’t save time as I’d have to push it on the way back. So I dumped the bike in the heather and continued up to the Y junction.</p>

<p>It was about 09:40, so 1-1:10 of cycling. My route was left at the Y, following the Coire Etchachan burn, past Hutchison Memorial hut and to the shores of little loch Etchachan.</p>

<p>Now the climb really started, and this brought the wind with it. It was relentless, reaching the peak at the top by the Loch.</p>
<p>I’d hoped the wind was just strong in the valley, and coming off the loch and that the summit would be better. Perhaps hoping in vain of course. The weather was not the clear skies forecast but very grey clouds, that I was about to be walking through. Not sure if it was raining or the wind just pushing huge volumes of air against me and the resultant water condensing made it seem like it was raining, but I was pretty wet all over.</p>

<p>Eventually a tor appeared out of the cloud and I thought I’d made it…looking at my map I realised it wasn’t and I still had some way to go. The next one appeared and I climbed up on top, but that was pushing it in the wind, and so I decided not to climb anymore. I thought the tors would shelter me from the wind but it seemed to come around from every direction and there was nowhere sheltered. I setup the mast and long wire, as I planned to start with 40m. I had the wrong guy ring for the carbon 6 and so it kept sliding all the way down, plus the peg into the wind kept lifting. I ended up putting three of the guys into the wind, plus pegging down the wire into the wind and it reached some equilibrium and held in place. It did remind me of the wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men.</p>

<p>40m wasn’t great, lots of QSB and I didn’t hang around long. Time for summit #2. Packed up and headed down into the Lairig an Laoigh. The sun was starting to peak through and once I was on the descent the wind abated. I took quite a direct route down, which was very steep and probably not the best route, although not sure where would’ve been better.</p>

In fact, not crossing the Derry Burn at the lodge and continuing on the east side until I got to the foot bridge would’ve been a better cycle path - oh well, I know for next time!</p>

<p>I had originally planned to do Ben Tirran, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-016">GM/ES-016</a>, with Hunt Hill, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-042">GM/ES-042</a>, starting from Loch Lee and going back and forth, but I had to do the school pick up so needed to be home by 3pm. For a while I still thought I could do both until I realised my time spreadsheet had an error, although it took writing an email to someone saying I was going to be on Ben Tirran at 2pm…and then home by 3pm :thinking: Anyway, I decided to just do Ben Tirran as it’s taller…(only if it were 4m taller still…)</p>

<p>Starting by Wheen farm, there’s a little area off the road where you can park, and, at some point during the year, even buy some refreshments!</p>

<p>The cloud was low but wind was minimal, and it was mild at 10 degC. The path is straight forward from the car park, with a small stream crossing at one point.</p>

<p>I did miss the turning, and then stomped across the heather to find the path. When I came back down I looked to see why I’d missed the turning…</p>

<p>Perhaps on a clear day it would be more obvious, and the small cairn would stand out.</p>
<p>As I reached the summit, it was getting brighter, and I had hopes of the sun breaking through. I setup on 2m with the FT65 and RH770 and called a few times. Soon enough I had five contacts, including G6BIA down by Newcastle - who I also got on Mount Battock the other week.</p>

<p>A surprise one was Fraser, MM0EFI, at home, with Mount Keen right between us. At this point the clouds parted and I was in glorious sunshine.</p>

<p>Also out was Denis, MM0CBC, up on holiday from Wales. He was on <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-027">GM/ES-027</a> and we had a nice summit to summit on 2m. Also impressive given the high peaks of Lochnagar, and Beinn a’Bhuird were between us.</p>
<p>Several people reported my audio kept dropping and I was difficult to hear, but the carrier was still strong. Think I’ve come to the conclusion the FT-65 mic/design isn’t that great (judging from commentary online) and even though I’m right next to it when talking, small movements cause the levels to drop. That sounded annoying for those at the other end, especially after I’d witter on for 3 minutes and they only heard every 5th word.</p>

<p>I setup for 40m and had plenty of contacts. I’d arrived at the summit sooner than I expected, and so could afford to spend more time on the radio. I tried chasing a few other summits, although not too many active at the time, but made contact with HB9CYX and @DG4SFF. Tried a little 10m, and was rewarded with W4GO and N2BTD on the east of the US. I thought about changing from my sloper L antenna to a vertical but then realised I didn’t have enough time for that. Packing up I heard someone calling on 2m and ended up having a chat with a few others. At this point I was now behind schedule and had to get a move on! Back into the cloud and a quick trot down to the car.</p>

<p>A very enjoyable day out. It’s a nice summit, with good take off for 2m, some shelter at the trig, and lovely views when the cloud clears. I could see many summits peaking above the clouds - Mount Keen, Lochnagar, and even across to Ben Avon. On a cloudless day, I bet the views would be stunning all round.</p>
<p>It’s almost been two years since anyone came here, <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-all-88-out-of-87-uniques-activated/31625">Fraser being the last of course 2</a>. Perhaps the route from either north or south isn’t great, and there are plenty of other options closer from both sides. However, it would be one I’d recommend. I did get Tim, G5OLD, on 40m and so now he’s compelled to come up for a complete.</p>
