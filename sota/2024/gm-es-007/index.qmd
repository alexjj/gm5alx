Alan, MM0VPM, was doing a [tour of the Cairngorms](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-002-003-and-007/36165) and the local SOTA group were listening out for him. I commented that no-one had done [Beinn Bhrotain](https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-007) for a long time, not even Fraser. His response was "how about Sunday then?". The offer included transportation and loan of a mountain bike, plus of course the guided tour, an offer too good to refuse! Free time on the weekends can be tricky, with several sets of kids actvities and potential birthday parties etc., so we needed to start early so I could be back in time for my wife to start her coaching session at the swim club. Fraser was good with that, and so our rendezvous was 6am in the Dinnet car park for onward journey to the Linn of Dee.

We'd all seen a photo recently shared of the midge in the area, which is quite unusual away from the west of Scotland, and sure enough, there were plenty about when we arrived and unpacked the bikes. We met a DoE group packing up their tents at White Bridge and they told tales of woe, and suffering in the evening, and the leader seemed very pleased to be going home. My wife later told me of one of her swimmers sending home a photo of a pan of custard he was cooking on his expedition which had a nice layer of midges on top. ðŸ¤¢

The weather was pleasent enough, although the promised clear skies had yet to appear and the cloud level was fairly low. We continued on our ride, following the Dee along a more rocky track with plenty of culverts to negociate. After around 7.5 km of cycling we left the bikes by the side of the fence and took the track up towards the first summit we could just about see, Carn Cloich-mhuilinn. The path came and went, or we found and lost it, several times but with the rocky peak to aim for it wasn't too difficult to navigate. Every so often Fraser would point out surrounding summits or features, completing with name, sota points and youtube URL, the names of which I'd immediately forget until he told them to me again on the way back down. The last 200m or so climb of this Carn was bouldery but nice underfoot, a bit like clambering across rocks at a beach. With the interim summit climbed, we admired the view. The cloud was still low, a few patches of sun appering in the distance and looked promising that it would clear for us, although not sure if in time for our final ascent. 

We had a good view across a small gully where the path was as obvious as can be. After a short descent down to a wee stream the path was lost to us. A few phantom paths appeared and we followed them, probably veering more towards the west than necessary, but we found a way. I kept my eye on SOTAGoat, to be sure I wasn't being led astray, and we soon found ourselves both within the activation zone and the cloud. The trig appeared out of the mist and we had made it!

Having eaten breakfast in Aberdeen at 5am, it now felt like lunchtime, even though it was only around 09:15. At this point I found out one of Fraser's secrets to successful moutaineering - [butteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttery_(bread)). Claiming "this was all he could find in the cupboard", he proceeded to eat what I'd estimate to be around 8,000 calories in a matter of minutes. Checking the schedule, we decided we had around 45 minutes on the summit before we should head back down. 

Fraser had brought the FT-857 and his [100g yagi](https://www.iz2uuf.net/wp/index.php/2013/04/06/100g-yagi/), and was hopeful to activate on 2m. I was on HF with the KX2, and the 18ft (5.5m) random wire vertical. We each found a suitable pile of rocks to shelter behind and set to work.

I started on 40m, the antenna needs a transformer to get a match, and even though it's short I've made contacts this way before. I thought I'd try 40m as maybe it's a desireable trig point, or WAB etc. place that folks would want. I could hear some contest callers but after my spot and calling with no replies, it was completedly dead to me, and so I moved to 20m. After spotting and calling CQ a slow trickle of replies came and I relaxed once I crossed number 4! The replies kept coming, including four summit to summit stations in Germany, Switzerland and Romania. I considered some other bands but time was marching on, my hands were cold and everything was getting wet. The sun suddenly shone through for a few moments and it looked lovely. Two runners then came by having climbed from the opposite side. They asked what I was doing, to which my usual answer is "amateur radio, speaking to other people on mountains". They were impressed with Switzerland, and asked if I could say hi from them. They soon ran off again, and given they were in running shorts and vest I'm not surprised they didn't want to hang around.

I could hear Fraser still calling and trying to keep his wind vane under control, got the thumbs up he didn't need to get on HF and I packed up. We had a brief celebration, this was my first 10 pointer, and then turned around and headed back down.
