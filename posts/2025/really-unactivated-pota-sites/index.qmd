Finding unactivated POTA sites is a problem that has previous been solved, I know of [one example](https://github.com/ianrenton/newparks/) by Ian, M0TRT, which generates a kml file for all the unactivated sites. This is nice but a single kml covering the whole world is a bit unwieldy. He does have a script to show nearby parks and how recently they were activated, with black being never. This, plus my [recent mapping efforts of summits](https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2025/sota-summits-in-the-cairngorms/), made me think a streamlit app doing the same thing would be nice. Enter [UnPOTA'd](https://unpotad.streamlit.app/).

It's not a very polished app, and I used Ian's code, but it allows you to pick a country and then it'll plot a map of those unactivated parks.

End of story. Right? Well not quite...

I showed this map to a [German ham friend](https://rz01.org/), and he found a [park nearby]( https://pota.app/#/park/DE-0378) which was supposedly unactivated but when he looked at it, it showed one person had activated it on the leaderboard, even though the stats reported zero.

![Inconsistent data](images/paste-3.png)

This got me wondering, what other parks are like this, where the stats from the API report zero activations and QOSs but there are activations appearing on the leaderboard...time for some more API queries! Each park has a leaderboard API endpoint which shows the activations and hunters, and so by checking each park that was originally reported to have zero activations I could make a list of parks which have incorrect stats.

This did take a while as some countries have a lot unactivated parks and each one has to be checked. I left it running overnight and in the morning I had a list of 99 parks across the world.

I emailed the POTA helpdesk and submitted a ticket, and so maybe they can fix them. In the meantime, if you're looking for unactivated summits, be sure to check the POTA site and the leaderboard as well as the stats, or you can use this table here, which is correct at the time of publishing. Feel free to use the [streamlit app](https://unpotad.streamlit.app/) too. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/alexjj/unPOTAd), including the script to find erroneous parks.
