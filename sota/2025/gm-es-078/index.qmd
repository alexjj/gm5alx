The second summit of the day. As the last day of the winter bonus it would've been good to do a 2+ pointer to get those extra three points, but I've done so many already that there aren't any left that I could do and still get back in time for school pick up. So I thought I'd tick this one off my list. I had been saving it to do with the kids but sometimes it's good to known the hill before you bring everyone with you!

It's a nice little hill in Ballater, and has many paths around and up it. I chose to take the shortest, but also steepest route up to the top. It is pretty steep! However, it doesn't take long and then you're at the top.

The summit is very nice, has everything you could want! A bench with a view, a cairn to climb on, trees a plenty, and lovely views of the village below, and the surrounding hills. On a good day, you'd get a very nice view of Lochnagar.

I set up a little way off the summit, using the trees to support my mast and the other end of the wire. It was a quick setup, and I was soon on the air. A quick run on 40m, including three summit to summits, plus a chat with Simon on 2m, meant I'd done enough in 15 minutes. Packed up and headed down the other side of the hill.

The eastern route around was much nicer to walk along and would recommend that way up as well, for a more gradual gradient. A nice little hill, and probably a good one for me to bring the family the next time, and then get a cup of tea or ice cream in the village afterwards!
