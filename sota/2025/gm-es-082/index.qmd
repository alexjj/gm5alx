Another early morning start with swim training drop off, so I thought I'd make the most of it and tick off another 1-pointer in the north. The weather was nice too, chilly but no wind and clear blue skies. I knew this would be a quick one as it's at most 30 minutes walk to the summit.

An easy route, car parking spaces and then follow the sign posted track to the summit. The hill is quite flat, so the activation zone is pretty big, and if you were in a real hurry you could skip a third of the walk! Soon at the trig point, I made use of a broken sign post that was lying by it to give some weight to my mast. This was because the cover was still in the trig point, otherwise I'd have used the hole in that.

I started on 40m and got the folks in our SOTA whatsapp chat group, but otherwise it was very quiet. Perhaps the early morning, it was 8am when I was on the air, and the poorer band conditions. K was 4 so a little limiting. Even more so on 20m as I only managed three more contacts. In total, more than enough for the activation though. Admired the view for a few minutes, with several SOTA summits visible in the area, then packed up and headed back down and off to work, arriving no differently than if I'd taken the kids to school!
