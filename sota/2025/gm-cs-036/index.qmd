I wrote a funny piece on the [reflector](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/unencrypted-transmissions-from-the-five-eys/37816) about this trip. You should read that too.

![An early start](glen-ey-53.jpg)

The weather ended up being spectacular for all of the school holidays, and I didn't want to miss out on using it - both the weather and the holidays, so I took the Wednesday off and asked Fraser if he wanted to go out. I wasn't quite sure where I wanted to go, I've got Cairn Toul and Braeriach still to do, and that's a big day out, but I also wanted to maximise points and ended up picking an even bigger day out! The Glen Ey 5 munros.

I left home about 4:30am to meet Fraser on the way, and travel with him to the start at Inverey. First part of the route was a 9km cycle ride, and then climb up to the first summit. Probably this and the next four summit reports will be mostly pictures and minimal text!
