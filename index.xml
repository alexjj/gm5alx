<p>Today the dads get to go off on a big walk! I had looked at a route doing Braeriach, Cairn Toul and Sgor Gaoith in one go, but it was pretty long, about 40 km, and would take all day. So we settled on a shorter route of Sgor Goaith - another Aviemore side summit - and also another munro, although not a SOTA summit, Mullach Clach a’ Bhlàir.</p>

<p>HF was okay on 40m, and 15m got Ukraine straight way. The most excitement was from 2m, just using my RH-770 and getting a S2S with Alan, MM0VPM, on Arran and then a QSO with MM6OEC in the Outer Hebrides 200km away. Then it was off to our second munro.</p>

<p>We were back at the holiday house by 2:30pm and then off to Boat of Garten bike pump track with the kids…who had all been winding up the mums during the day. So probably good we didn’t do the all day route!</p>
<p>I have to say Mullach Clach a’ Bhlàir is the most boring munro I’ve been to so far, but I can tick it off and never visit again! It is a HEMA summit and I did think of trying to activate it, but I wasn’t that interested and didn’t really have time.</p>

<p>This turned into the second summit of the day, after Ord Ban. I wasn’t quite sure when I was going to be able to do this one. I had wondered if I could do it in the afternoon after the planned dad’s hike up Skor Goaith, however, an opportunity presented itself after we went for lunch. Some other friends were also staying in the area and were going to come round and play with everyone down by Loch Alvie, so I didn’t feel too bad for disappearing off. I thought I’d cycle up to Glenmore from Aviemore to climb the hill and then cycle back. Turns out this wasn’t an insignficiant distance, and added a fair amount to my climb!</p>

<p>I cycled along the cycle path the way there, which was nice but it seemed to take a longer route than the road and have some more ups and downs. I’m glad I checked the map a few times as if I’d kept following it, I would’ve ended up on a huge detour. After about 30 minutes, I found the start of the walk and locked up my bike.</p>
<p>![Up to the summit]](meall-a-bh-7.jpg)</p>
<p>The path is very clear the whole way up, and easy to follow. There was a bit of a cool breeze but if that wasn’t blowing then it was a very warm climb. It was also pretty busy with lots of people coming down as I was going up. The summit has a big cairn at the top, but it was very busy so after a quick selfie I looked for somewhere else to setup, and ended up walking down the south side to a big rock to sit on.</p>

<p>I tried 2m first, as Fraser was sure he could work me on 2m from his house. I had a few other calls on 2m, including George, MM0SAX/M in his van driving down the A9 and ended up talking to him for a while. This was whilst Fraser was walking around his village with a yagi and HT trying to work me! Eventually I let George go and got the call with Fraser. I was in two minds about HF, one it was a glorious day and I was just sat in a tshirt on the hill side having fun, but also the fact that I would be much longer than I originally told everyone. So HF it was 😅. I tried out my new guys for the carbon 6 mast. They were fine, although there was hardly any wind, so not much of a test. I perhaps cut them a little short as they were quite a steep angle from the mast. HF was pretty good on 15m, into Greece and the Canaries, so that was nice.</p>

<p>I packed up and hten headed down the ridge on a straight path back down. This only took me 15-20 minutes to get back to my bike. I’d drunk all my water, so I stopped at the visitor centre for a coke and asked them to refill my water bottle. I then had a 45 minutes cycle back to our house. I stuck to the road, and it was mostly downhill, apart from the roundabout and bridge over the railway line going around Aviemore. Back to the house and found everyone had been paddleboarding and had lots of fun, so no worries there!</p>

<p><a href="ordban-1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-074/ordban-1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>For the Easter holidays, we’d planned a trip to Aviemore with some friends. The weather continued to be absolutely lovely, with clear blue skies and warm temperatures everyday, it was like a summer holiday! My objective was to activate the three GM/ES SOTA summits that are this side of the Cairngorms during our trip. We’d planned a day’s hiking, so GM/ES-009, Skor Goaith, was going to be fine, but I needed to find slots for this hill, Ord Ban, and the Corbett, Meall a’Bhuachaille. There’s a nice loch next to Ord Ban which is ideal for cycling around, and this was one of the planned activities - even without my suggestion! My hope was to then find some time to quickly run up this hill. It’s a small one, and you can climb it in about 15-20 minutes, and so after our cycle round, everyone was playing in the Loch and it was time for me to go up.</p>

<p>Once I found the start of the path, it was straight forward. It’s a nice wee hill with plenty of space on the summit and trees and a trig point to keep you entertained. There were some other people climbing it, so I found a space off to one side and setup there. The bands weren’t great, and it felt like the only stations I could hear were other summits. I didn’t want to hang around too long, and so didn’t try longer than my 6 contacts before packing up and heading back down.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It’s quite a long walk to An Socach, although enjoyable, particularly around Loch nan Eun. The side up An Socach is steep, and several reports mention this, particularly when done as the loop of 5 munros. Although skipping it doesn’t make the route much shorter.</p>

<p>Once we were done, we headed down the ridge and back to our bikes. The cycle ride was mostly downhill and an easy end to the long day. Back home by 18:30, meant I was out of the house for 14 1/2 hours! What a great day!</p>

<p>This was a slow climb up the steep, pathless side until we got to the track near the top. Slow as it was steep but also as it was number four.</p>

<p>A bit of a shorter walk between number 2 and 3, compared to 1 and 2. Once you reach the base of the hill you can also see number 4, Glas Tulaichean’s steep sides that we’ll have to tackle afterwards.</p>

<p>I wrote a funny piece on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/unencrypted-transmissions-from-the-five-eys/37816">reflector</a> about this trip. You should read that too.</p>

<p>The weather ended up being spectacular for all of the school holidays, and I didn’t want to miss out on using it - both the weather and the holidays, so I took the Wednesday off and asked Fraser if he wanted to go out. I wasn’t quite sure where I wanted to go, I’ve got Cairn Toul and Braeriach still to do, and that’s a big day out, but I also wanted to maximise points and ended up picking an even bigger day out! The Glen Ey 5 munros.</p>

<p>I left home about 4:30am to meet Fraser on the way, and travel with him to the start at Inverey. First part of the route was a 9km cycle ride, and then climb up to the first summit. Probably this and the next four summit reports will be mostly pictures and minimal text!</p>

<p>I was running a little behind schedule, but this next summit wasn’t too far away and I thought I could get up it quickly enough. So a short drive later and I’m at the bottom of Knock Hill. It’s about a 230m vertical ascent over a short distance and it’s quite a slog when you’re trying to fit in time for tea, cake and banter in Huntly before school pick up back in Aberdeen.</p>

<p>A quick round of everyone on 2m again, then it was time to chase Simon still on his summit. This time on 10m. Not quite as strong but still a clear 51 both ways. With enough in the log, and the tiny tree providing equally tiny shelter, it was time to head down and off to Dean’s for an enormous slab of malteser slice and tea.</p>
<p>We were so busy explaining igates, digipeaters and LoRa to Chris that we didn’t take photographic evidence of the cakes…at least not before I had to leave back to Aberdeen. To then run into a huge procession of bikers on the A90 doing 40 mph.</p>
<p>Lots of S2Ss, and four completes for me today! 🏔️ Only two points today but lots of fun! Just Ben Aigan left up this part of the region, and I’ve chased Chris on it, so another complete awaits!</p>

<p>This was our <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-north-east-of-gm-es-activity-day-friday-28th-march-2025/37757">GM/ES North East activation day</a>, where we all activate some of the 1 pointers to the North of Aberdeenshire. I certainly need to activate several of them to complete the ES region, and it’s nice to get some completes as well as have a day out with lots of people out and about. Makes it more fun when there’s some 2m activity, plus we all try to meet up afterwards for “tea and medals”.</p>
<p>Well what a windy day! Don’t think we were expecting it to be quite this bad, however, no-one was blown away! 🥳</p>

<p>I was doing Bin of Cullen, GM/ES-084, and then Knock Hill, GM/ES-073. On the way there the A96 was closed by the police, and no diversions had been setup, so it was a random drive following Google Maps hoping to return to the A96 further north…of which the first attempt was still closed by the police. Anyway, I made it, and it only cost about 15 minutes. The others had already started and many comments on whatsapp about the wind were pinging on my phone. Apart from the wind, it was a lovely day.</p>

<p>Some trees and hillside kept me sheltered from the worst of it, and I worked Chris, 2M0RVZ, on Meikle Balloch, Archie GM4KNU on Lochnagar, and a new SOTA activator, Jane, 2M0IZS on Lord Arthur’s Hill (recently inspired to try SOTA thanks to a presentation by Mike 2M0WNA at the Aberdeen club). Fraser was driving still, so a mobile 2m FM contact with him.</p>

<p>A chap walked by whilst I was setting up HF but he didn’t notice me, mostly had his head down due to the wind. He did wave hi on his way back down.</p>
<p>Simon, GM4JXP, was in The Canaries on EA8/GO-001, and was a booming 58 on 15m to me. I chased another activator in Poland, to end up with 6 S2Ss, before it was time to head over to the next summit.</p>

<p>Another early morning start with swim training drop off, so I thought I’d make the most of it and tick off another 1-pointer in the north. The weather was nice too, chilly but no wind and clear blue skies. I knew this would be a quick one as it’s at most 30 minutes walk to the summit.</p>

<p>An easy route, car parking spaces and then follow the sign posted track to the summit. The hill is quite flat, so the activation zone is pretty big, and if you were in a real hurry you could skip a third of the walk! Soon at the trig point, I made use of a broken sign post that was lying by it to give some weight to my mast. This was because the cover was still in the trig point, otherwise I’d have used the hole in that.</p>

<p>I started on 40m and got the folks in our SOTA whatsapp chat group, but otherwise it was very quiet. Perhaps the early morning, it was 8am when I was on the air, and the poorer band conditions. K was 4 so a little limiting. Even more so on 20m as I only managed three more contacts. In total, more than enough for the activation though. Admired the view for a few minutes, with several SOTA summits visible in the area, then packed up and headed back down and off to work, arriving no differently than if I’d taken the kids to school!</p>

  <title>Brimmond Hill</title>

  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-086/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Mike, 2M0WNA, was off out to <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-087/">Waughton Hill</a>, and I wanted to chase to get a complete. I wasn’t quite sure if I’d be able to do so from home on 2m, and so I thought I’d run up Brimmond and also get a summit to summit. It’s very close to home, and within 30 minutes I can leave my house and be at the top having a QSO.</p>
<p>I did take my HF rig but I was hoping to qualify on 2m, and get back home again. Luckily, I did manage to as Simon and Fraser were around to help with 2m QSOs.</p>
<p>Brimmond has a lot of masts at the top, and you tend to get interference on 2m. Last time I was there I had a different 2m HT (I forget which, perhaps ft-65?) and I’d get interrupted with buzzing and beeping so I couldn’t hear the other side. This time, with my Alinco DJ-VX50, I didn’t get any noise but it would just cut out, making it equally difficult to hear.</p>
<p>I’ve since found an old ft270 on ebay, which supposedly has a very good front end for filtering unwanted transmissions out, so next time I’ll have to try that.</p>
<p>I didn’t take any photos as I was in a hurry, and I’ve been here a couple of <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-086/">times before</a>. I am thinking that I should use the hill more often when I’m trying to chase and don’t think I’ll make it from home. I won’t always be able to go, probably just during the week if I’m working at home and want a quick walk, but it’s worth doing.</p>

<p>The second summit of the day. As the last day of the winter bonus it would’ve been good to do a 2+ pointer to get those extra three points, but I’ve done so many already that there aren’t any left that I could do and still get back in time for school pick up. So I thought I’d tick this one off my list. I had been saving it to do with the kids but sometimes it’s good to known the hill before you bring everyone with you!</p>

<p>It’s a nice little hill in Ballater, and has many paths around and up it. I chose to take the shortest, but also steepest route up to the top. It is pretty steep! However, it doesn’t take long and then you’re at the top.</p>

<p>The summit is very nice, has everything you could want! A bench with a view, a cairn to climb on, trees a plenty, and lovely views of the village below, and the surrounding hills. On a good day, you’d get a very nice view of Lochnagar.</p>

<p>I set up a little way off the summit, using the trees to support my mast and the other end of the wire. It was a quick setup, and I was soon on the air. A quick run on 40m, including three summit to summits, plus a chat with Simon on 2m, meant I’d done enough in 15 minutes. Packed up and headed down the other side of the hill.</p>

<p>The eastern route around was much nicer to walk along and would recommend that way up as well, for a more gradual gradient. A nice little hill, and probably a good one for me to bring the family the next time, and then get a cup of tea or ice cream in the village afterwards!</p>

<p>The last day of the winter bonus in GM land, and so I was looking for places where I could do multiple summits - it doesn’t matter which ones, as long as they’re 2 or more points, as I’ll probably visit them all this year. However, I also had to be back for school pick up and I don’t think any of the pairs of summits left could be done in time. So I settled on Creag Bhalg and then do one of the one pointers on the way home. I’d chased Simon on here during the winter GM/ES activation day, and so it would be a good complete for me.</p>

<p>The suggested route has you park opposite Victoria bridge and walk over it - cars aren’t allowed over - and this is quicker than parking at Linn of Dee or further along somewhere. It means you walk through the estate a little before crossing the road and starting the climb up the hill.</p>

<p>After Culardoch, it was time for the next hill! I enjoyed the snow drifts on the way down, bounding along, sinking knee deep into the snow. This was then replaced with climbing the steep side of Carn Liath (the previous summit here: <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-020">GM/ES-020</a>). Once up on the plateau the hike is easier, although the amount of rocks does mean you need to watch your footing.</p>

<p>With the change in summits by 1-2 m, the new summit is further to get to and it’s easy to lose track of the number of summit cairns you count on the way! Only from the map can you tell which is highest. When the cloud opened, you were rewarded with amazing views across to Ben Avon and Beinn a’Bhuird, and looking back I could see Culadorch and somewhere Fraser climbing up to the top. Fraser and I had a little chat whilst walking, just to make sure the other was still there for the complete.</p>

<p>40m was still reasonable for me and I had a steady stream of QSOs. There is a little shelter behind the rocks, but the wind was much calmer so the wind chill had dropped considerably. By this time Fraser appeared on the radio again, this time at the summit, and this QSO marked the moment of both of us completing our pair of completes!</p>
<p>I remembered I’d offered to try 2m to the locals, and Simon GM4JXP and Mike 2M0WNA were both nice and clear on my Alinco and RH770.</p>
<p><a href="creag-an-db-1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-7"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-088/creag-an-db-1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>Fraser had told me his mast had snapped at the top, supposedly from freezing between summits but also maybe from the rage of finding the plastic bottle in the trig point. 20m wasn’t great, but fortunately 2m was, and meant Fraser could qualify.</p>

<p>I packed up and started back towards the bikes. The wind had definitely dropped, and it was warm work walking back. Our timings worked out well, as we saw each other walking down towards to the bikes, and I arrived just a few minutes before Fraser did.</p>

<p>Winter woollies off; downhill racing gear on, and we headed back. It is only after hurtling down the track at 40-50 kph do you realise just how much of a climb you did on the way out. The memory was quickly returned when we hit the uphill section, complete with slowsand. We did pass a couple of older walkers, who still got a fright as we went by even though there was much bell ringing. Back through the gates and down the track towards the forest.</p>
<p>Whilst going down at, according to my watch, 28 kph, I tried to avoid a rock, but then my front wheel hit some smooth rock side on, and I went sideways and downways. Whilst I avoided the rock, I’d hit several others, and everything else on the ground. Remarkably limited injuries, except my nice walking trousers, and an apple in my side pocket 🍎💥, I got back on the bike. Fraser looked concerned but did comment he wish he had his GoPro on, as those videos get a lot more views. At a slightly more cautious speed, we continued down through the trees and back to the estate road. Again, greeted with some uphill sections, just to finish you off - this section is particularly painful after doing <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/">Ben Avon and Beinn a’Bhuird</a>.</p>
<p>Back to the car, loaded the bikes and after 25 km, and 5 hours round trip, Fraser wasn’t looking for some extra at the other end and I dropped him at his house. Home for a nice cup of tea before back in the car again.</p>
<p>A good proper winter outing, and two more GM/ES off my list, thanks Fraser! 💯</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After discussing it for a while, and finally finding a time between, work, weather, and mid-morning coffee appointments, Fraser, MM0EFI, and I were going to do Culardoch (<a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-015">GM/ES-015</a>) and, the ever popular, Creag an Dail Bheag (<a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-088">GM/ES-088</a>). We’d originally planned to go on the Monday, following a weekend of lovely spring weather, but our plans changed as quickly as the weather and we didn’t think 50-60 mph winds and snow was a good idea. Thursday looked to be the calmest of the week, and still within the winter bonus period.</p>
<p>I picked Fraser up on the way, him having cycled 5 miles from his house to the main road to meet me, and we headed to Keiloch car park in the Invercauld estate.</p>

<p>Our plan was to each activate one summit, then swap over and activate the other. They’re not quite equidistance from the intersection but with activating we could manage this. As always, I was working to a deadline to get back home in time for various kids activities and taxi duties, so no dillydallying. My schedule suggested it was about an hour to cycle, then 2 hours or so walking back and forth, 40 minutes cycle back plus activating time.</p>

<p>The route was cycling from the car park up to the intersection of the two summits, I’d do Culardoch first, whilst Fraser headed towards <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-088">GM/ES-088</a>. A short cycle along the road, then we turned off up a track in the trees. It was a steep start, and was a taste of what was to come on the rest of the cycle.</p>

<p>We continued on, through a couple of gates, and ever upwards. A brief moment of relief on a downhill section, but all the time thinking about coming back up it on the way home! The path is very good the whole way, although with the water from the snow melt, the fine sand/stones was like quicksand - or perhaps slowsand - as it was arduous to cycle through. After around an hour, we gave up on cycling uphill through the slowsand, and pushed the bikes most of the way to the junction.</p>

<p>The air was cold, and the wind was picking up a little as we reached the junction. The snow drifts were decent at this altitude. The route to Creag an Dail Bheag was mostly pathless, and whilst there is a path to Culardoch, much of it was filled with snow.</p>

<p>The weather was partially cloudy, some blue skies, but some low cloud. Culardoch was in the cloud but Creag an DB looked to be in the sun, although this changed all the time. We checked 2m frequencies, and the plan, and set off on our own ways. We did both get treated to horizontal snow on the way up, and when that stopped, then just a cold wind.</p>

<p>As I climbed up the cloud was thinning and I was hopeful of a sunny summit by the time I got there. Looking around the views were very good, and at times being able to see all the high peaks.</p>

<p>The wind was very cold and continuous, not too strong, but I was very grateful of the trig point to hide behind. My plan was to activate on HF, pack up and then wait for Fraser to reach his summit for a 2m S2S (although we should’ve done 70cm), and then head down and across. The trig point was promising for an easy mast mount, except for some previous visitors who decided to use it as a bin and jammed their rubbish and plastic bottle down the hole. I still managed to use it though.</p>

<p>Another part of our plan was that I’d do 40m and Fraser would do 20m on the summits, plus the potential S2S with Andy GM6ZAK and Archie, GM4KNU, who were also out. I’d managed 10 on 40m, when I saw Andy’s spot, and so called him. We managed our QSO, and then Fraser popped up on 2m. So with our S2S done, I knew it was time to pack up and head across. The locals did call me on 2m but my bare hands were absolutely frozen at this point and I couldn’t bring myself to continue with it - we’d already had QSOs on 40m, so no-one was left out!</p>

<p>After the first summit today, I was back to the car, up the road to the Lecht ski centre for Carn Ealasaid! It is very close, so seems silly not to do it. I did this <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-030/">one last year</a> with my daughter, the weather was also lovely, although once I got on the air the cloud moved in and we had to make a quick exit. I was taking the same route today.</p>

<p>Simon was still on the Buck, so another S2S with him. Fraser was back home but called in on 2m. 2m was dead otherwise, so back to HF. This time 40m, a S2S with England, then a S2S on 17m and then one QSO on 10m to <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/N4EX">North Carolina</a>.</p>
<p>Back down to the ski centre, for a cup of tea and slice of tiffen to go.</p>

  <title>Carn Mor</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In a somewhat reminiscent turn of events as the <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-025/">GM/ES Winter Activity Day</a>, a few folks were planning on going out as Gerald, G4OIG, was planning his visit up here. Unfortunately, Gerald was ill in the week and had to cancel 🤒).</p>
<p>However, we had Fraser, MM0EFI, Simon, GM4JXP, Mike, 2M0WNA, myself, and Alan, MM0VPM, was trying hard in England. We weren’t all quite lined up for the same activation time, for various reasons, but we were likely to all overlap at some point.</p>
<p>I decided to do Carn Mor, and was going to climb it starting from the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/119437626">Lecht Mine car park</a>, which leads to the Lecht Mine or the Lecht well.</p>
<p>I was one of the latest activators, and on my drive over, I stopped near Corgarff castle to chase Fraser on GM/ES-023 - a complete for me. Then continued further up the road to a layby near the ski centre to chase Mike on GM/ES-068.</p>

<p>The route follows the path by the stream towards to mine but before you reach it, you turn off and climb up Càrn Liath. The stream has to be crossed, and it’s not a wee burn, nor a great river, but enough to make you ponder the best way over. I went with a running jump at what seemed like a narrow part and felt that was a close call right at the start!</p>

<p>The track kicks up on gradient pretty quick, and you climb the 300m elevation in about 1.6km. You’re now at virtually the summit height but still with 3 km to go, with some ups and downs on the way.</p>
<p>The aerial maps show plenty of peat hags on the way up to the top of the first hill but I seemed to manage to avoid them. It was, however, not going to be the case the whole way, and once beyond the nice path next to the fence does one face them.</p>

<p>The south side of the hags seemed easier (as I tried on the North on the way back) and once I got past them I wasn’t really paying attention to the map and continued to follow the track up the next hill. Only to realise this was an unnecessary detour. However, in my detour, I’d managed to avoid some more compared to taking the direct route, so I think a middle ground between going up the summit and the straight line route is best (this is what I’ve added to <a href="https://www.sotamaps.org/tracks">sotamaps</a>.)</p>

<p>That was the last false summit, and now the end was in sight.</p>
<p>As you can see, the weather was absolutely lovely - also just like the last time Gerald didn’t visit. A slight breeze but nothing much. After not too much longer the trig appeared in sight.</p>

<p>I managed a 2m summit to summit with Mike, and Simon but Fraser had left, and so he called me from the peat hags on Brown Cow Hill.I setup on HF and had a go on 40m.</p>

<p>I seemed to be getting rf on the audio on 40m, with the KX2 on the trig point. I moved it onto the ground that that seemed to cure things. Once 40m had dried up, I considered moving to other bands but then I also considered a second summit - given it was such a nice day and I’d driven all this way. So I packed up and headed back - eating my noodles as I walked.</p>
<p>I did try and take a more direct route on the way back but the peat hags said no, and I was better off just following the route I took out.</p>

<p>I was up way too late last night trying to decide what summit or summits to do today. Given it’s still winter bonus period, I’m incentivise to activate the most number of summits, and so I was trying to see if I could do two summits. Generally, two summits in a day is perfectly reasonable, however, I was constrained by school pick up and drop off, and the fact that I’ve done just about all the nearby 2-pointers already. I looked around for another summit, and eventually decided up <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-026">Sgor Mor</a>. Tim, G5OLD, recently activated this summit at the start of the month when we did our <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-025/">GM/ES activation day</a>. However, prior to Tim, no-one had activated this summit since 2021. There’s a good reason for this!</p>

<p>I looked at different routes for it, to make sure I could make it up and back in time. The most common way, is to go up the side to the ridge and walk along it to the summit. It’s rough going, as there’s no path for 90% of the route and it’s all heather and bog. There’s also a very long deer fence which just ends in the middle of nowhere. Although there were piles of new fencing laid out on the ground, so I guess they’re coming back to finish it. An alternative route, is to cycle along the Dee, past white bridge and the Chest of Dee, until you’re at the base of the summit. This should only take about 30 minutes, and then you have a steep climb up to the summit. It minimises the amount of heather and bog to cross, and overall it looked shorter. The downside of this, is that you don’t get to do the ridge walk. If the weather is clear, then the ridge walk offers outstanding views into the high Munros of the central Cairngorms - Devil’s Point, Cairn Toul, Ben Macdui, the lot. As well as views to the south to various Munros and high tops. As the weather was looking nice, I decided to go with the ridge walk. I did put the bike in the car, just in case weather was different in Braemar than in Aberdeen, but I didn’t use it.</p>

<p>My route had a short section of the track along the Dee but then turned off and headed straight into the heather, up a steep slope. My route was just a straight line to the ridge, and I tried to follow it as best as possible, whilst avoiding particularly boggy parts. I’d set a pace marker on my watch to do the ascent in 1:20 (vs.&nbsp;the 1:30 predicted) just to give me a bit of extra time to setup and to eat my lunch. It wasn’t quite the perfect blue skies of Aberdeen, but it was clear enough. Once I eventually reached the ridge, I did have great views into Luibeg, <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-013/">Carn a’Mhaim</a>, and all along to Devil’s Point. I kept thinking I was nearly there, and summits I’d seen on the walk up must be my destination, but no, there was still plenty of ridge to walk along!</p>

<p>Higher up, the heather did revert to the alpine, low to ground plants, and so it made it easier to walk. However, now quite a cold wind was blowing, and at times there was snow. The snow on the high tops had much reduced since I was on Carn na Drochaide. I did make it to the summit in 1:20, giving me 10 minutes before my alert time. There’s a little cairn at the top, and that was enough to shelter in and keep out of the wind. The stones weren’t very big, so it wasn’t ideal for supporting the mast but I managed to wedge it in and got the job done anyway.</p>

<p>I did quickly try 2m, to see if I could get the local SOTA lads. I hadn’t even spotted but a random chap from south of Edinburgh came back to my CQ call straight away. We had a brief chat, and then I could hear Fraser, MM0EFI, calling. I called back but he couldn’t hear me. I didn’t want to be spending too long on the summit, it was cold and I’d only allocated myself 30 minutes, so got started setting up HF.</p>

<p>I started on 40m, and there was a quick pile up, although it seemed to quickly disappear, without me working that many. A S2S from the Lake District called me too, and I ended up working a few on 40m before being able to hear the locals. I moved to 20m and continued to work stations calling in. I had seen a Czech summit and did call to them but they couldn’t hear me over the others, again, not wanting to hang around I didn’t keep trying. However, one caller told me they were calling me - and I couldn’t hear them for the other chasers - and so I eventually managed to work him on OK/MO-074 around 1,600 km away. By now it was 12:30, and I needed to get going. So I packed up, finished my lunch and headed off. Simon asked if I was doing 2m, so I did get the HT out and make another QSO with him. I probably didn’t have time for that but nevermind.</p>

<p>I did meet someone else coming up, just as I was leaving the summit, that was surprising given the remoteness of this Corbett. I didn’t volunteer to chat as I had to get back to the car. Going back along the ridge was fine, but soon I had to turn back into the heather and bog. It was downhill all the way, but still tricky to move at speed. Eventually, I came to the hill slope down to the Dee path. It’s quite steep and going down is as difficult as going up. The heather means you can crash your way down, but just being careful of large boulders, or even small cliff faces. I did make it back onto the path at 13:30 - the time I was hoping to leave the car park - and so tried to walk and jog my way back to the car.</p>

<p>Back to the car 15 minutes later and then off home. The duration of the drive varies so much depending on if you get stuck behind tourists, or Land Rover drivers doing 45 mph for miles and miles, but I managed to make reasonable time and get back with 5 minutes to spare!</p>

<p>It’s quite a remote 4-pointer, and a good amount of work to get there, so it’s not surprising I’m the 9th activator of the summit. If you’re visiting the area, there are so many other hills to do before you’d do this. One for the completionists I think! However, it does offer some of the best views, and so perhaps shouldn’t be overlooked so quickly.</p>
<p>I’ve now past 350 points, and I’m hoping to get to 400 before my Lake District trip in April, as then this should see me over the half way mark to Mountain Goat! My rate will slow down once winter bonus period ends, although with the weather getting warmer (hopefully) there’ll be opportunities to do some of the big hills again, maybe trying different routes if I did them last year. There are a few overnight trips I’d like to do from home - so I can start the walks early in the morning - but finding time with everything else in the family is always the challenge! Still, those hills aren’t going anywhere. ⛰️</p>

<p>Another early morning start, and another opportunity for a pre-work SOTA activation. Last week I did <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-060/">Coiliochbhar</a>, but it was too wet and windy to go across the road to do Lord Arthur’s Hill, and so I decided to head back today. The weather was lovely, clear blue skies, and only a gentle breeze.</p>

<p><a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-062/">Last time around</a>, I climbed it from the south, through the estate. I thought I’d try another route, and a common one is from the east. The track up is very straight forward and it’s a land rover track the whole way up.</p>

<p>I was trying to time my summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, who was across the other side of the Cairngorm’s National Park trying to tick off some of those summits. He ended up being later than me, so I did HF first, and then hung around for a bit to get a S2S with him over 2m.</p>

<p>I’d setup on the trig point, as I didn’t think there’d be anyone else coming up this morning. I used the random wire, starting on 40m and then moving to 20m. Both bands were good this morning.</p>
