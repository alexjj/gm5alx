Fraser, MM0EFI, and Tim, G5OLD, were going out to [Conachcraig](https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-019/) today and asked who else was going out. I was keen to go (as always) but lots of family activities were going to limit me. So what better way to solve it, than to bring the kids with me!

It was a bit cold, around 0-1 Â°C when we set off. Everyone was excited to go at home, but when we got there everyone was complaining! We made reasonable time to the top
