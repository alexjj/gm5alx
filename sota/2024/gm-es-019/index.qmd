 It felt like a short, straight up route on a nice track. I turned and looked back at Lochnagar and could see the cloud hovering over the summit, although not submerging it.

The rock formations on Conachcraig are interesting to look at, I haven’t really got a good photo of them so you’ll have to go there yourself. Unsurprisingly, no-one else was at this summit with me and I ducked down behind a rock to keep out the wind whilst I setup again on 2m.

Thanks again to Fraser [@MM0EFI](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/u/mm0efi), and Chris [@2M0RVZ](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/u/2m0rvz) for their contacts on both summits, then with Simon [@GM4JXP](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/u/gm4jxp) and finally Richie GM1LKD in Aberdeen I was set. It was now 3:05pm, and I needed to be home by 5pm, and with an hour+ drive, it was time to pack up and head back to my bike.

The downhill bike ride back only took 20 minutes, and was a great way to end the trip. 28 km all in, and home in time!
