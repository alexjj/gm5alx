A bit further to drive this time to the start of Mealna Letter, but plenty of space to park by the path entrance into the woods.

![](mealna-10.jpg)The track up is straight forward, just follow the track. When you come out of the trees, then the path disappears and you just make your way up the hill. It’s hard to go wrong as you’re aiming for the junction of the walls on the top of the first hill.

You then follow the wall along the top until you get to the summit. If you’re lucky the wall can be a wind break and makes it a pleasant walk. The summit cairn is away from the wall, and is worth visiting as it offers some nice views down to the loch below.

The sky was still clear and offered stunning views all around.

After two summits on VHF, I thought I’d try HF, particularly with the nice wall to shelter behind, and so setup for 40m.

I had a nice run on 40m, and start chasing summits on other bands. By this time it was 1:30pm and I was 1:30 ahead of schedule. I was starting to debate if I had enough time for a fourth! Ideally, I wanted to be leaving the area at 3:30pm to get home by 5, so if I could run back to the car by 2pm, then I’d have time…not for Mount Blair but for it’s neighbour, Meall Mor, [GM/ES-058](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-058). Time for one [Meall Mor!](https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-058/)
