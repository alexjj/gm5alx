[Fraser](https://www.youtube.com/@theradiorover) was off today and asked if I was around for a summit. I managed to rearrange work things so I could go out in the morning and catch up later. The forecast was showing strong winds and potentially rain. Luckily the rain never really happened, but boy, was the wind strong!

I was meeting Fraser at Dinnet, then we'd drive the rest of the way to the start of the summit.

It's a nice route through the forest and then along the top with good views across to Lochnagar. It took us about 1:15 to get to the summit. The final summit has two peaks, one with a cairn and one without. The wind was so strong here that we stuck at the cairn site. I setup down the leeway slope out of the wind a little.

I'd managed to leave my phone in my car, and so had to get Fraser to spot. This also meant no photos of the trip...Guess I'll have to go back again! I also had to use paper logging for the first time, but managed okay!

Fraser setup at the cairn and was on 40m. We didn't stay that long and soon got off the summit. We did check out the other side and the wind was insane over there, I could hardly stand and if I'd taken out my bothy bag I reckon I could've taken off. We headed back down and then into Ballater for a second breakfast.

Fraser has done a nice write up of our trip on the [reflector](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-twin-peaks-and-a-gale/37019).
