Not quite [a year](https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-018/) since I last went up it, but back again on the same route. The weather wasn't quite as nice as last time either, with low cloud and a cold wind. This time I knew about the false summits and it didn't seem nearly as bad as before. Also I've climbed a lot of hills since, so probably got better legs than I did the first time!

This time I spotted the little cubby with some provisions and bits in, that's inside the cairn shelter. I should make up some SOTA stickers and leave them in there next time!

I left a little note in the guest book and then setup. I did a little 2m at first, but my hands quickly got cold, and then setup on HF. Have a good run on 40m and then 20m, with several S2Ss. I was having fun but it wasn't the warmest and I also had to be back for school pick up, so packed up and headed down.

My view of Morven has changed from my least favourite 4-pointer to, somewhere in the pack. Once I do all the 4-pointers I should make a [list of them](https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/geallaig-a-hill-for-all-seasons/37470?u=gm5alx).

I saw some runners come by, just in shorts and t-shirt...hope they don't trip and fall... and have a chat with an older guy making his way up. It was nice to get back below the cloud and see further than 20m in front.

I look forward to coming back next year.
