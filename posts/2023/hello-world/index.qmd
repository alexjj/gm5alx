Iâ€™ve decided to make a dedicated amateur radio blog. Partially, so I can ~~run WordPress~~ now running [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)!

I hope to record contacts I make, things I build, antennas I try out, and generally anything related to amateur radio.

It will be no surprise to anyone that my callsign is GM5ALX. and a .uk domain was much cheaper than a [.radio domain](https://register.radio/), even though .radio is cooler!
