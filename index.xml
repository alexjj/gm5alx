<p>My auntie was visiting for the weekend and she’s a keen hill walker, so of course we had to go out! I picked Gaellaig Hill as it’s not too long, and close to Ballater for a nice lunch afterwards and then still home in time to do school pick up.</p>
<p>Whilst yesterday the weather was lovely, and the forecast looked great over the weekend, today was much greyer and wetter. Thankfully it had stopped raining by the time we reached the start, and even a little blue sky appeared.</p>

<p>The walk up was straight forward, following the track right to the summit. I forgot to take any photos of the summit, but there’s a nice cairn you have to climb into with the trig point, and you’re very well protected from any wind. The rain less so, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Whilst the radio is somewhat of a novelty for her, I didn’t think that would last long. Fraser, MM0EFI, knew I was going up and we had a quick QSO on 2m, but then I jumped straight to 20m on HF. It was quite a considerable pile up and I really struggled to make anyone out. There was some QRM, tuning, tones that kept sounding too which made it harder. Probably if I had headphones on I would’ve done better but I at least wanted auntie to be able to hear.</p>

<p>Had a few England and Welsh stations come back who were booming signals, and cut through the pile up! Quite the short skip on 20m. Managed three summit-to-summits in England, Italy and Germany too.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, it was time to pack up and head back down…and warm up again! We went into Ballater - the first time I’ve actually been there! - had lunch at The Bothy and had a look around a few shops. Some classic granny shops on the high street!</p>

<p>The kids have been enjoying the <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-077/">previous</a> <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-087/">adventures</a> we’ve gone on, and wanted to go out again. Tim, GM5OLD, was going to be going up Sgor Mor but had hurt his knee on the descent of Morven, so called it off. I’d originally planned to go up Craigendarroch, as that’s likely to be in reach, via 2m, of Sgor Mor, but as we weren’t constrained by that anymore, I decided Fourman Hill would be a good summit. It’s quite a low summit and the route up is short, around 1.3 km with 115m of elevation change. Makes for a nice pleasant walk, also when you’re carrying a tent, lunch for four and various things the kids want, you appreciate the short trip! If I was on my own, it would’ve only taken 20 minutes to get to the top.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should’ve done it that day I did <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-071/">three 1-pointers</a> in the area - then I could’ve used Mike’s, 2M0WNA, joke about being a four hill man.</p>

<p>Weather was good today, nearly clear blue skies, although some wind, particularly on the summit. The walk up is mostly sheltered by trees but when you near the top these are sparse and we were getting blown about quite a bit. The trig point is in the middle of some gorse and there’s not much space around it. We found a nearby tree in the heather to setup camp.</p>

<p>The kids kept out of the wind in the tent and had their lunch in there. I setup just behind a tree and used another to tie off the random wire in more of an inverter L shape rather than the usual inverted sloper L. I also had the slim G on the mast for 2m. Fraser, MM0EFI, was first in the log on 60m. I thought others would come but after about 10-15 minutes of calling, no-one else appeared so I moved to 40m. Whilst the CQ Worldwide DX Contest was going on, there was still space on the band and I worked 5 stations - including Tim, GM5OLD, from his camper van across at Glenshee.</p>

<p>As the contest was on, I thought I’d make the most of it and see what DX I could work. I moved to 10m and the band was chock-a-block! I started with a few European and Russian contacts, and they were easy to work. Everyone just gives you a 59 in a contest so not sure what my signal really was but when they come back after my first call and get my callsign correct, it must be a pretty decent signal. I saw Barbados, 8P5A, on the cluster, so thought I’d give them a try. It took a few attempts but eventually managed to get through! My first transatlantic SOTA QSO!</p>

<p>I switched the antenna to the 5.5m random vertical and started at 29.000 MHz and worked down. Lots of US stations at this end of the band and pretty much each one I tried, came back straight away. I heard many stations worldwide, Canada, Aruba, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, but didn’t manage to work them. It’s always a trade off of how long do you keep calling them before you decide they can’t hear you due to propagation vs.&nbsp;being drowned out by bigger stations. Plus the kids had had enough by this point and wanted to move on.</p>

<p>I did join the lunchtime net and made a couple of local contacts on 2m, I didn’t spot on 2m or try calling, as I wanted to spend the time on 10m instead. We were back to the car in 20 minutes and nearly everyone fell asleep on the way home! A friend at work asked me about good walks for kids, and thanks to SOTA. I now have a long list of nice walks to recommend!</p>

  <title>Brown Cow Hill</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Tim, GM5OLD, is up in the area and doing a few summits. I took the opportunity (with kind support from the family…for the morning at least!) to be out at the same time for some S2S action. Tim was going up both Mona Gowan and Morven today, and so I picked a 4-pointer nearby - the very Scottish sounding, Brown Cow Hill.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="brown-cow-14.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Corgarff Castle"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-023/brown-cow-14.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Corgarff Castle"></a></p>

</div>
<p>The route starts in the car park for Corgarff castle and takes a nice track up the hill. Weather was okay, some low cloud and the possibility of rain in the afternoon. Our rendezvous time was around 10-10:30am. After my previous epic journey up two high peaks, this felt like a walk in the park. There was almost no wind and that alone made it enjoyable.</p>

<p>I soon entered the cloud and visibility dropped considerably. This was fine whilst I was following the track but after a while it mostly disappears into the heather…and peat hags.</p>

<p>There must’ve been some serious water coming down as the channels carved by it were huge, I had to make quite a few detours to find crossable areas without having to scramble down a muddy cliff face. It was wet and boggy underfoot, and I had plenty of full foot submersions.</p>

<p>Near the top, I emerged from the cloud and could enjoy some of the scenery again. A very new looking fence seemed to cross across the path but luckily a gate was nearby, so I didn’t have to clamber over it. Being out of the mist, I was rewarded with some lovely views across to nearby summits, including <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/">Ben Avon</a> I recently did. There wasn’t any snow at the top of them any more, they were out of the cloud and probably enjoyed the minimal wind as I was. Today would’ve been a much better day to climb them! If I did have the whole day, it would’ve been good to try Ben Macdui or some of the other high peaks too.</p>

<p>I reached the summit about 10am and setup my mast with the slim G and sloper L random wire antenna. The complete lack of wind was so enjoyable, although I still managed not to fully extend the mast and it collapsed on me! I knew Tim was nearly at the top too, so once setup I just listened to the bands and had something to eat. Unfortunately, just at the moment the cloud came in and the lovely views disappeared - oh well!</p>

<p>I brought the G90 and 4Ah LiFePO4 battery today. I like the G90, it’s a bit heavier than the KX2, but as my first radio, I have a soft spot for it. It’s pretty capable, especially given the price, and 20W and a tuner than can match the 5.5m vertical random wire on 40m is pretty sweet. 20W over 10W probably makes no discernible difference, but I do like the little waterfall for finding quiet spots on the band. If I’m going on a long walk, and multiple summits, I’d probably stick with the KX2. If the weather is bad, I’d lean more to the KX2 also, as its form factor makes it easier to keep hidden from the rain in my shadow or a plastic bag. However, on a short walk, and nice weather, I’d probably take the G90, or if I just want a change.</p>

<p>I had some nice QSOs with Tim, GM5OLD, Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ, on 2m. I could hear Bill, GM0NRT, in Aberdeen about a 31, but he couldn’t hear me. Tim had Bill as a 59, but it seemed Mona Gowan/Morven were enough to block my signal. Tim and I had a nice chat for a while, on 145.500, but there’s no-one around here so it doesn’t matter 😅, and then we both went to HF. Plenty of contacts on 40m, in England, Ireland and into Europe. I hunted a few summit to summits, with a pair in Italy and one in Norway. I moved up to 10m, a band I’ve not tried much, usually as I’m in a rush and once the summit is qualified I’m off, and got several more stations in Europe and a couple into “Africa”, the Canary Islands, receiving 55 and 59 from them.</p>

</div>
<p>I was meant to be home by 1pm but I was having a blast on the air, and the weather was pleasant, so I ended up staying at the summit for much longer than I planned. However, I did have to get back, so I packed up and headed down. I tried walking a straight route from crossing the fence back to the main track, but managed to wind all over the place. There did seem to be fewer peat hags on the way back, although the few that there were, they were a lot steeper. I also managed to miss the turning on the track back to the castle and looked up to find the castle much higher than me, so then scrambled up the side of the slope to get back on the proper track. At this point it started to rain a little but I was nearly back to the car.</p>
<p>I’m only the 8th person to activate Brown Cow Hill. It’s clearly not a popular summit, and likely one for just those looking to complete GM/ES or other lists. There are plenty of other ones nearby that are more appealing. However, if the weather is clear, you get some stunning views all around, and the walk up isn’t that bad - around 6.6 km and 425m ascent, with minimal ups and downs - just the peat hags to deal with but other summits have those too. I still stand by that Morven is the worst summit for brutality of ascent!</p>
<p>Here’s Fraser at the other end of our 2m QSO.</p>

<p>After activating <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/">Ben Avon</a>, and a brief stop for some food, it was time to head back to The Sneck and then up to Beinn a’Bhuird.</p>

<p>The frozen burns were interesting, some I could walk over, and some were only partially frozen. The small waterfalls would trap air underneath and then the bubbles would travel under the ice for a few meters before escaping.</p>

<p>The summit was hard to find, my GPS route had come to an end but I couldn’t see anything. Some general blind amberling around eventually found it hidden in the cloud. I was a bit disappointed in the cairn, I was hoping I could at least hide in it, and even when crouched down behind it, the wind still got me.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to spend ages messing about, trying to get setup on HF, but nothing would stay still. The wind pulled out guys and pegs, it bent the top of mast over 90° and so wires would come off, I angled the mast 35° off the ground into the wind, and the top still bent over enough for the wire to be pulled off. I held the mast with my body weight but still the wind could pick me up with only the surface area of the mast! Just when I had everything set for 40m it all blew down :sweat_smile: I thought I’d try 2m but that was just as challenging. I could hear the local lunch time net in Aberdeen but it was hard to get a word in edgeways and I’m not sure they could hear me anyway. So back to HF it was, this time with a short 5.5m vertical random wire for 20m. This I did manage to make some contacts with but, again, the wind blew me and the mast over mid-way through a QSO. By this time I was fed up, cold and wet, but had qualified the summit, so it was time to go! Also, there was no signal just behind the cairn…to add to the fun.</p>

<p>I generally took the same route back, without a compass, or device with a compass, it would be impossible to know which way to go. At one point on the way back it was so windy I could lean into the wind and it would hold me up! But I was soon back at The Sneck and heading down, and it wasn’t long before the conditions were more pleasant again. The weather wasn’t quite so nice down in the valley on the way back, but much nicer than on the summits. Found my bike, generally took the same route back, and was pleased to arrive back at the car to drive home.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After a lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar trip</a> the other week (with the now amusing subtitle of windy munro), I was keen to do some more high summits before the weather got worse and the darkness set in. Although turns out the weather is already worse! It’s school holidays here, so with no family schedule constraints, I could go out for the whole day, and I decided to try these two big uns - Ben Avon and Beinn A’Bhuird, pronounced Ben Ann and Ben a Vour respectively.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="route.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Journey there and back"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/route.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Journey there and back"></a></p>

<p>The route is pretty standard for these two, parking at Keiloch, paying the £3.50, then cycling, before hiking. I decided to bike as far as I could towards The Sneck (the T junction between the two summits at 986m), and just retrace my steps from Beinn a’Bhuird back. This is instead of doing the loop where you walk from Beinn a’Bhuird North Top (the full summit name) to South Top across the plateau, then down the side and meet the path again after crossing Quoich Water. As I could see the low cloud I thought I’d rather not be walking that route for the first time, and just retrace my steps. Although given my “retracing” aka wildly veering route, and the completely indistinguishable terrain, it probably didn’t matter. It also meant more cycling on the way in, which helped my timing, for a chance of a good summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, on Mull.</p>

<p>The route in has a few parallel paths, including the Fairy Glen, and I’m not sure I took the best ones, and had to push the bike up some steep rocky parts in places. I tried the other way on the way back and it wasn’t much better, and then I missed the turn and went through the Fairy Glen - although didn’t see the secret howff (a hidden bothy), but also didn’t look very hard as I wanted to get back.</p>

<p>The weather was reasonable in the morning, patches of sun between the clouds and fairly mild for 8am. The forecast had the summits in cloud with strong winds, 30-40 mph with gusts of 50 mph. However, until I got to The Sneck, there was minimal wind, but boy, once I did! 🌬️ It was absolutely relentless, with my hood acting like a reed in a trumpet with an enthusiastic player. I gave the edge a wide berth, not trusting myself if there was a sudden gust that I wasn’t braced for. Snow was minimal on the way to the Ben Avon summit, with just small pockets that resisted being blown away.</p>

<p>Out of the mist the tor emerges and I have arrived! Peaking through the rock formation - which acted like the mouth piece of the trumpet - revealed more snow on that side.</p>

<p>I found a nice rock to hide behind and setup the slim G on the carbon mast. My last activation on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-030/">Carn a’Gheoidh</a>, suffered a lot from the mast bending too much in the wind and the antenna sliding off. Up until this point, I’d forgotten about this and so hadn’t prepared anything else. Luckily the slight sheltering seem to keep the antenna on and I managed to make my QSOs. The most exciting was a summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, who’s on Mull and was up <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SI-016">GM/SI-016</a>, 100 miles away. We were both on HTs and slim G antenna!</p>

<p>A pretty big sun CME hit and caused some lovely aurora all around the UK, however, this meant the bands were wrecked this morning. K of 7. Although dxheat was showing 40m activity in Europe this morning so I thought I’d try it. I had wanted to do some 20m to get a some nice EU contacts, as I thought that might be more interesting.</p>

<p>My mum is visiting and after all the sunny hillside photos I’ve been sending her, she wanted to come out and see the sights for herself. The weather wasn’t quite as spectacular as recent outings to <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">An Socach</a>, but it was nice enough. After we dropped the kids at school, we headed up. There’s a dedicated car park, Tap O’Noth car park, and a nice track all the way to the top, so it was a straight forward walk. My mum did have a stroke about 11 years ago, and that does limit her at times. I’d hoped this summit wouldn’t be too much for her. When you arrive you’re greeted with this huge lump that sticks out of the ground and looks imposing, I thought I took a photo but it appears not.</p>

<p>With a few stops on the way, we all made it to the top in good time. The cloud had come in a little and it was much windier but still decent weather. The top of this hill used to be a fort back in the Dark Ages, and so offers plenty of shelter from the wind.</p>

<p>I setup near the trig point in a nice recess in the side. I’d brought the G90 and my 5.5m vertical random wire. The G90 can match this tiny length of wire on any band, even 40m! Although probably longer wires would be better. I’d also brought my end fed half wave, but the 5.5m vertical is so fast to setup. As I was worried the novelty of watching me on the radio would wear off soon, and the cold wind would get to everyone, I stuck with this vertical. I gave 40m a shot, and did manage to just hear Phil, G4OBK. We were both 31 with each other. I then heard my HT as locals were chatting and asking if I’d already been and gone or what had happened. I’d emailed earlier in the day saying I was going up but had put 11am and we’d left later so it was closer to 11:30am.</p>

<p>I had the RH-770 on the HT and joined in the conversation, saying I was on the summit. Simon, GM4JXP, and Chris, 2M0RVZ, quickly called in and I was more than qualified. Simon was testing a new home made 5 el yagi and was absolutely deafening when he called! I tried one more CQ but I’d done the job so thought it was time I packed up and headed down - we didn’t want to be late for lunch! My mum liked the chats we all had on 2m, and said everyone sounded very friendly. If I had been on 20m or higher frequencies, it might’ve been exciting countries but nothing more than callsigns and RST exchanges.</p>

<p>The trip down was easy enough, we actually met a few other walkers on their way up, and we were back in the car heading to Alford to try out a cafe for lunch. Soup and sandwiches all round with a sense of accomplishment by all. A very enjoyable trip out. Tap O’Noth will be a good one to do during the Winter bonus period (30 Nov-14 Mar) to get 5 points from it! The shelter the old fort offers is very nice for keeping out of the cold winds!</p>

  <title>Getting started with Bunkers on the Air</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/bunkers-on-the-air/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve heard about it before but only just looked into bunkers on the air (or UK BOTA). Turns out there are a lot of sites around and good way to get out and about, use the radio, explore your local region and maybe learn a little bit of history.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of useful sites to get you going:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bunkersontheair.org/site/">Main site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bunkerbase.org/">Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bunkerbase.org/bunker-3/">Maps</a>
<ul>
<li>The Google Map didn’t appear for me, but the OS map is nice, or use the combined on below:</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://kwirk.github.io/pota-gb-map/">Combined awards map</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be within 1000 m of the bunker location (with the right permissions etc.)</li>
<li>Qualify the bunker with 25 HF contacts or 10 VHF+ contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d recommend joining the WhatsApp group listed on the website, and you’ll get invited to the spotting group too.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the number of bunkers locally to me, especailly compared to doing SOTA activations and having to drive at least an hour to get anywhere!</p>
<p>I’ve not activated one yet but there appear to be plenty that have never been done near me.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After a lovely day yesterday on Lochnagar and Conachcraig, I was looking to see where I could go today. There was a swimming competition on, in addition to the usual activities, so I needed to be back for 3pm. Last week when I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">An Socach</a>, the others went to Carn a’Gheoidh, and I remembered them leaving later than me but arriving at the top at the same time. Sure enough when I check all the times, it looked doable to get there and back in time. The longest part is the drive to Glenshee ski centre, and that’s right at the limit of the electric car - returning home with 20 miles range still makes me a little nervous!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>The weather forecast had it cloudy with chance of showers and reasonably breezy. It did rain a little on the way out but was dry when I arrived. I wasted about 10 minutes getting a parking ticket from the cafe - I should’ve just opened the link in the car park when I was up the hill and had signal, like I did with Glas Maol.</p>

<p>The track follows up the ski maintenance tracks, which are quite steep to start. There’s a shortcut across part way up which I just walked right past. My Inreach mini started beeping as I’d gone of course and so I backtracked and found it. It was a small track at right angles to the main path just behind a fence, so not too obvious, so thanks to the Garmin!</p>

<p>I was soon in the cloud and did check on the inreach every so often to make sure I was heading in the right direction. I doesn’t have topo maps, and just a line but it has a compass and so points in the right direction and is enough to make sure you’re following the right path.</p>

</div>
<p>I didn’t see much on the way up, other than about 20m around me, mostly looking like the photo. In exposed places the wind picked up a lot and gave me a good push. At one point I was about 3m from a small loch and I didn’t realise until I was right upon it. The track was decent and only in a few places was it boggy but nothing like The Buck. The final ascent to the summit is steep again after a while of walking on the mostly flat plateau. At this point the wind was howling and I was glad there was a cairn at the top.</p>

</div>
<p>I setup behind the cairn, which was a very good shelter from the wind, had a sandwich and then got on the air. I thought I’d try a bit more power on 2m and see if I could get any further than usual. I’d brought the Kenwood V71 and battery. This is the first time I’ve taken it out with me, and I also haven’t used it much at home, so I was hoping I wouldn’t get into any operating issues with it! I had the slim G, and was glad I hadn’t brought the yagi to try and setup in the wind.</p>

<p>I now wonder if I’d setup the mast on the outside of the cairn pointing into the wind, if I could’ve made it more vertical. Particularly as right at the end the antenna got blown off and I ended up holding it with my arm to finish the QSO - I didn’t do an EMF assessment on that setup…</p>

<p>It was a little slow to start, but eventually I’d work 9 stations, including GM4OAS 90 miles to the west in Mallaig. I did find the lowest squelch on the V71 was quite high and not breaking for several stations. I eventually turned it off and then heard several locals and others. I do wonder how many had been replying to my CQs before. Did 50W make any difference? The map looks remarkably similar to when I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-012/">Glas Maol</a>, and that was with the 5W D72 handheld. Technically, it’s 10 dB which is 1.x S points, and on Glas Maol GM4OAS gave me 32 and this time he gave me 42, so whilst not more power, I was readable more? I do like the form factor of using the mobile rig with the fist mic, means I can position things easier than being tied directly to the end of the mast, but probably for the most part it makes no real difference and it’s all in my head!</p>

<p>Keeping an eye on the time, I needed to pack up and head back. The wind was still relentless and on the top I had to lean into it. I was grateful of my big hood as I followed the path back down. It’s amazing how you can forget some of the details of the walk on the way back, being surprised that I had to climb up and down a few places which I didn’t remember on the way up to the summit! For a few moments the wind seemed to blow the clouds away and there was even a hint of sunshine coming through. The view opened up and I could see all around. Certainly not the spectacular views of <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">last week</a>, but enjoyable for the few moments. Back down to the car and back home.</p>

<p>I think this summit and Glas Maol would make a nice day trip out, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with the option of a hot lunch at the ski centre cafe. For 6 and 8 pointers, they have fairly easy and short walks, and both great locations for 2m, particularly to the south. Doing both would be 14 points, and a lot less walking and climbing than my 14 point day yesterday on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-019/">Conachcraig</a>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been eyeing Lochnagar <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-008">GM/ES-008</a> for a while, and this Thursday’s forecast was looking reasonable, so decided to take the day off. It’s little neighbour, Conachcraig <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-019">GM/ES-019</a>, is asking to be activated at the same time. I was going to take the common route starting at Glenmuick, but Fraser, MM0EFI, suggested biking from Balmoral castle.</p>
<p>As I was trying to fit this into the family schedule, any time I could save would be an advantage. I used <a href="https://www.plotaroute.com/">plotaroute</a> to figure out the times for the biking and hiking sections, matching the speed I think I move at, plus the drive back and forth, it looked like the cycle route would be the quickest. 8:05 hrs for the cycle route vs.&nbsp;8:40 for the walk from Glenmuick (times include driving). I considered cycling from Glenmuick but supposedly the path isn’t great beyond the forest, so not really worth it.</p>
<p>Was only a few degrees at the start in Crathie car park, but cycling generally uphill and in the sun I was soon roasting! It was around 1:15 cycle up to the intersection of Lochnagar and Conachcraig and I’d had enough of the bike! Much of the route is a gentle incline but there are areas where it’s steeper and much less enjoyable.</p>

<p>I met a nice German couple on the way up Lochnagar. They’d been in Scotland for nearly 3 weeks and had brillant weather all round. Climbed Ben Nevis, Ben Lomond and visited several cities and towns.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Of course the weather is always like this”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A german ham I know told me: “Nice German” is as redundant as “false error” or “undead zombie”. His choice of words. Enough chit-chat, I had a schedule to keep and kept going.</p>

<p>I’ve not been on a popular summit for a while and was surprised to see so many people on a random Thursday. I say so many people, it probably it was about 15, but compared to zero to two, it seemed a lot.</p>
<p>The forecast had said cloudy in the afternoon and I was due on the summit at 1300 local so I was hoping it would stay clear. I wasn’t disappointed.</p>

<p>I waited my turn in the queue to take photos at the summit, offering to take those of others. The wind was strong at this point and you wanted to be sure of your footing whilst scrambling about on the top. The views were incredible in all directions, and anyone on a summit in GM/ES would’ve had a great day.</p>

<p>I’d made it to the top ahead of schedule but I spent a long time admiring the views and walking around. The wind was strong so I looked for somewhere sheltered and away from the main path to setup, but ended up just sitting on the grass to one side. With my back to the wind it wasn’t too bad. I setup the slim G on the 6m mast and used my HT to call CQ. I was hoping to qualify the summit on 2m and in short order to keep on my way. I also noticed the clouds rolling in from the south. Got 5 in the log, mostly the locals plus Jace MM7VXJ who called when I was eating a biscuit. Credit to Jace for trying to relay messages to Jack, GM4COX, who was a 59 for me but think I was a 01 for him, and he wanted to move to sideband. I was surprised not to get anyone else further south.</p>

<p>Time to head back. I should’ve taken a photo of Conachcraig from the summit, as it looked tiny from atop Lochnagar! All around the cliff edges are openings that just drop away, and on a lovely sunny day they’re interesting to look at but if it were cloudy these are a literal death trap!</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">big hill</a>, it was time to do the small one - <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-019">Conachcraig</a>. It certainly looked small from Lochnagar summit but it’s still a respectable 865m tall.</p>

<p>It felt like a short, straight up route on a nice track. I turned and looked back at Lochnagar and could see the cloud hovering over the summit, although not submerging it.</p>

<p>The rock formations on Conachcraig are interesting to look at, I haven’t really got a good photo of them so you’ll have to go there yourself. Unsurprisingly, no-one else was at this summit with me and I ducked down behind a rock to keep out the wind whilst I setup again on 2m.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ for their contacts on both summits, then with Simon, GM4JXP, and finally Richie, GM1LKD, in Aberdeen I was set. It was now 3:05pm, and I needed to be home by 5pm, and with an hour+ drive, it was time to pack up and head back to my bike.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/906901577214402/?locale=en_GB">145 Alive!</a> event was planned for today between 1-3pm, which I wanted to join in with. Should be the perfect time to activate a summit on 2m! I had the three little kids with me for the day, so it had to be a easy summit. Particularly as I wanted to bring up the tent and lunch and things for them, to keep them entertained whilst I was on the air. The previous times I’ve brought them, I’ve only been about 20 minutes at most and trying to go much longer would be tricky. Eventually I want to qualify all the GM/ES summits, and so Waughton hill is on my list. It’s quite out of the way with nothing else nearby, so it’s a trip in itself and for one point, I’m not wasting a day off on it! It’s also the lowest summit in GM/ES, and seemed perfect for our adventure.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>The path up is short, although does cross a field full of cows, and you soon find yourself by the white horse. Walk by its head and you’re on the top of the rise, and heading towards the old hunter’s cottage. The actual summit is a bit further away, requiring you to go down and up the side of the hill again. However, the hunter’s cottage is in the activation zone and the kids thought we’d reached the top and started playing in the house. There was also a nice piece of grass without any sheep or animal droppings on it for the tent I’d brought. The tent and mast went up easily enough and lunch and various toys were unloaded into the tent. It was about 12:55 and I wanted to be on the air for the start of the event, so I swallowed down my rolls and setup the IC-705. Turns out the coax on the slim G with the 6m tactical mini mast is just a little too short for the radio to be on the ground. I usually don’t notice as either using the carbon 6, where the antenna sits a little lower on it, or a HT which I’m holding at standing height. So I ended up having to hold the 705 in my hand the whole time.</p>

<p>I’ve not long had the IC-705 and whilst it is very simple to use, sometimes I get into some modes or settings that I don’t know how to get out of. Today I was already on 2m FM but would the VFO change the frequency? No.&nbsp;First I was worried I’d bashed it in my bag and the dial was broken, then thought perhaps I’d selected 10 or 100 Hz increment but that didn’t seem to matter. I ended up just pressing stuff and then going to band and choosing 144 MHz again seemed to fix it. Phew!</p>

<p>It was nice having the waterfall to see is there was any activity and there certainly was some! I knew MM0EFI and MM0RFN were going up Ben Macdui and Glas Maol respectively, but not sure if they’d got to the summit in time. Fraser was supposed to be on 145.250, so I tuned to it and heard Bill, GM0NRT, talking to someone but couldn’t hear the other end. I was worried I couldn’t hear Fraser on Ben Macdui, but turned out was just someone else. Tuning around, I heard a guy down at the car park by <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-085/">Hill of Garvock</a> and ended up qualifying the summit with those on his net. I managed to work four summit to summits, two on Ben Macdui, Glas Maol and then Morven. I heard a station down in East Lothian calling on 145.500 but he didn’t hear my reply. After about an hour, I had 10 QSOs and thought it was about time we packed up.</p>

<p>We headed back down, and went to <a href="https://adencountrypark.org.uk/">Aden Country Park</a> for some more fun. Turned out to be an old timey tractor fair and there were loads of them on the roads as we drove there.</p>
<p>Was a fun day all round, and nice to join in with this event. Maybe next time I’ll try for a higher summit!</p>
<p>The guys up Ben Macdui had a <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/carn-amhaim-gm-es-013-ben-macdui-gm-es-001-slightly-broken/36399">fun trip.</a>. Not jealous in the slightest…😅 Also afterwards, Chris, 2M0RVZ, was boasting about his points compared to mine…challenge accepted!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Fraser, MM0EFI, messaged asking who wanted to do a Munro midweek, and I thought it was a good opportunity to go. He also rallied Chris, 2M0RVZ, and Simon, GM4JXP. I decided to go up An Socach, whilst Fraser and Chris were going up Carn a’Gheoidh, and Simon on Glas Maol. A notice was posted on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/upcoming-2m-activity-wednesday-25th-september/36335/65">reflector</a>, and several others were keen to go up summits in Scotland and England. Later on we came to realise that the time posted on the reflector and Alerts was two hours late! Oops…no wonder no-one else turned up “at the right time”.</p>

<p>I got to the start around 7:45, and it was a chilly start, with -1.5 degC in Braemar as I drove through, however, the weather was stunning with clear blue skies and not a breath of wind.</p>
<p>I cycled along the estate track until the actual ascent starts - probably saves about 20-30 minutes walking each way, as I thought Fraser and Chris would have a quicker walk back on their summit. I need to buy an actual mountain bike as this and Mount Keen the other week have felt like I was going to shake the bike, and me, to pieces. The bike made a helpful support when crossing the ford before turning up the hill.</p>

<p>The first cairn is only 6m below the actual summit but still around 2km away. At this point I called in with Fraser and Chris on the HT, and they were a similar 1.5km away from their summit.</p>

<p>Lots of good views and, as already said, lovely weather! I found a nice grassy patch near to the cairn to setup the yagi.</p>

<p>Some good QSOs on 2m FM and SSB, not quite what Fraser managed but his summit was higher and so he was in the way! 😅</p>

<p>After calling for a long time on sideband I was impatient on FM and kept jumping around when I saw activity on the waterfall, either following Fraser like an annoying puppy, or jumping onto the calling frequency when it was free. Probably should’ve just stayed still!</p>
<p>I made use of the flat plateau and large activation zone to start heading back but still ready with the HT for Alan, MM0VPM. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sota-goat/id590206108">SotaGoat</a> app kept me in check and that saved a bit of time coming back. My worries of being slow down were unnecessary as I ended up being at the Bothy for a full round of cakes before the others arrived…and I couldn’t let them feel guilty for eating in front of me.</p>
<p>G4IPB reported hearing me on from <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/G/LD-008">Blencathra</a> - in the lake district just north of Keswick - and after seeing his report I realised that I also heard him but we were in the middle of some other QSOs so I never followed up and changed frequency. I was only on the HT and RH770 but he’d give me 55 and he was clear to me, although the first QSO was a bit muffled and dogs barking made it unclear.</p>
<p>The views were spectacular all around, with snow on the high summits.</p>

  <title>Largo Law</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My wife and I had a trip away for the weekend, and I suggested a nice walk nearby…which of course was a SOTA summit! We were staying near St.&nbsp;Andrews, which is quite a flat area, however, there are a few granite lumps you can climb. Today’s one was Largo Law. If the weather was good, we’d have a lovely view of the Forth, Edinburgh and East Lothian. However, that wasn’t the case today…more like gray and cloudy.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>The route is straight forward, as shown on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-259">Sotlas</a>, park at the school/cemetery, up towards the farm and then straight up the hill! The track was tricky in places as the ground was dry and covered in loose soil, but we made it up fine.</p>

<p>I setup the slim g on the 6m carbon mast, put out a spot and called CQ. It took a few calls but stations did start coming back. Good coverage across Glasgow, Edinburgh and up to Montrose area. Had a nice chat with GM4PKJ, who lives very close to where we used to live around 10 years ago. His wife is a ham too, but I didn’t realise until I got home and looked him up on QRZ, otherwise I could’ve said hi to her too.</p>

<p>Got my four contacts and packed up. My wife was sat nearby and commented the radio conversation was so “old man”. It was mostly what’s the weather and setup but I probably do adopt some old man tendencies when talking…it’s as though you’ve got to fit in. I should just ignore that and say whatever I want. Although I do like describing the weather on a summit, as quite often it’s different from “ground” level.</p>

<p>I had my Lora tracker with me and looked up if I’d been tracked. Two stations across the water had followed me up and down the summit. One was a new one in the centre of Edinburgh owned by <a href="https://gm5aug.topple.scot/">GM5AUG</a>.</p>

  <title>The Buck</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Not wanting to waste a glorious day, I had time for a quick activation in the morning and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-039">The Buck</a> was the recommendation.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

</div>
<p>The route is pretty easy, not quite a straight line as I’ve drawn but I parked slightly east on the road and walked up until I met this fence line. A quick march and you can be at the top in 30 minutes. The sub-500m area is pretty boggy and wet, even today when it hasn’t rained in a while. It was a little slow in places, trying to avoid plunging my feet into ankle deep water. The path is also vague at this stage but then becomes more defined within about 1km of the summit.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>The weather was amazing, brilliant sunshine, blue skies and not a breath of wind. I was roasting on the way up!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="buck-4.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-4" title="Trig point on top of the rocky summit"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/buck-4.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Trig point on top of the rocky summit"></a></p>
<figcaption>Trig point on top of the rocky summit</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Even at the top the wind was minimal, and I’ve never seen my carbon-6 stand so straight at a summit before! I made use of the nice clear hole in the trig point and put the mast in it with the slim g on top. I could see for miles and miles!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="buck-6.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5" title="Setup for 2m"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/buck-6.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Setup for 2m"></a></p>
<figcaption>Setup for 2m</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I was hoping it would be a quick activation on 2m, as I needed to get back home by lunchtime, and this summit would cover a huge area. Back from his hols in <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-sota-rough-guide-to-barbados/36296">Barbados</a>, MM0EFI was first in the log. After 5 minutes, Bill in Aberdeen, GM0NRT, called back, and whilst we were talking I heard another station call. This time it was GM0UDL up in Fortrose, just north of Inverness who had seen my Lora tracker being picked up by GM4SJB (even further north!). He told me about his lora setup and how everyone around that area has setup iGates and DMR repeaters. Sounds like a great setup they have. Not long afterwards my fourth 2m contact, needed to qualify the summit, came from GM8ZKU across to the east by the coast. Again, another nice QSO with Simon for the first time. Time was getting on and I did need to be back home, I tried on more CQ but then called it a day.</p>

<figcaption>Looking North</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>had a quick look around for the <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/aberdeenshire/the-buck.shtml">ancient engravings</a> but couldn’t find them. It was a quick walk back down the hill to the car. I’d forgotten about the sogginess but managed to escape with dry feet.</p>
<p>When I got home I looked up the Lora tracking on <a href="https://lora.ham-radio-op.net/">EA2RCF’s mapping page</a>, and was surprised to see just how far away GM4SJB’s receiving igate was! It had also tracked me nearly the whole route up and down, which I then realised was me walking the county boundaries. The power on the tracker is tiny and the antenna isn’t amazing but this time it all worked well. I’ve been carrying it with me on most summits but there haven’t been any igates nearby that have picked me up.</p>

<p>A nice quick 4-pointer summit - I’m beginning to think <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-018/">Morven</a> is a brutal 4-pointer! - although not for a wet day, or post a lot of rain. The summit is quite exposed, although maybe you could find some shelter depending on the wind direction. It’s a popular summit to do with Tap O’Noth, as that’s just a few miles away, however, I just didn’t have time on this occasion. Maybe they’ll be a good combo next year during the winter bonus period.</p>

  <title>FTDX10 and Omirig - for CloudlogCAT</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/cloudcat-with-ftdx10/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog">Cloudlog</a> for my logs, and have also recently migrated to <a href="https://github.com/wavelog/wavelog">wavelog</a>. Both of these share the same API which you can use with various CAT command software to get data from your radio into the logging program. Most useful for when doing live QSOs and to have it update the frequency and mode for you.</p>
<p>One such tool is <a href="https://github.com/magicbug/CloudlogCAT">CloudlogCAT</a> (windows only). It uses omnirig behind the scenes to interface with the radio. Other tools can be seen on the <a href="https://github.com/wavelog/Wavelog/wiki/Third-Party-Tools">wiki</a> pages of the two loggers. I had this working on another laptop but for various reasons was using a different one. I’d setup the vertical again in the garden and brought out the FTDX10 to use. I spent ages faffing about trying to get this to work and eventually found the right settings.</p>

<p>I also have a nicer way of setting up the spiderbeam mast using a base clamp wooden block and guy wires attached to a hose clamp with rubber nitrile protecting the mast. It takes no time at all to setup, and the remote ATU, radials, cables, and radio are all critical path items now!</p>

<p>I might upgrade to 4mm rope for the guys, as the cleats don’t have much area to bite and in high winds they did slip.</p>

<p>Another day off and the forecast was promising blue skies and sunshine. I’d spent the evenings this week trawling sotlas trying to figure out where to go. It was our youngest’s P1 stay and play this morning, plus swim training after school, so I had to fit my trip into that window. I’ve been finding I go faster than OS Maps walking prediction but yet to keep detailed enough records to figure out my speed, so planning a new location is always hit or miss (along with the <a href="https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/">alerts</a> I post!) To complicate matters more, I was planning on cycling the first part of the route before walking. I settled on Mount Keen and left after a fun session with the P1s.</p>

<p>I was also going to go the Glen Esk route, from the south, vs.&nbsp;the Glen Tanar one from the north. I thought it was a closer drive to home, but it was actually further, however, I think the walk is shorter this way. The road into Glen Esk seems to go on and on and on! Plus no end of dumb pheasants to watch out for on the road. I’ve actually done this hill before, maybe 12/13 years ago and on that trip we ended up walking through a blizzard! I can’t remember if we even made it to the top or decided to head back down, to then find the stream crossing to be more challenging than the way up!</p>

<p>I cycled from the car park, just before the Lochlee Parish Church, along the north side of the river. My bike is a “hybrid” which is more road bike than mountain bike but has thickish tyres. I think this was probably the limit for it, as it was quite rocky and the ride was very rattly! I made it, and it cut off a good chunk of time but wasn’t always pleasant. I set off at 10:45 from the car park, and cycled for 30 minutes to just before the stream crossing in the picture above. The terrain is fairly flat with only a small incline the whole way. You also pass the Queen’s Well, which is nice to look at if you’ve never seen it before.</p>

<p>The path is very clear and well made the whole way, some places its been eroded by water, or repaired with big chunks of rock. The roadway keeps going and you have to make sure you turn off towards Mount Keen.</p>

<p>After an hour I’d reached the top and had my HT out as MM0VPM was on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-009">Sgor Gaoith</a> and I was hoping for a summit to summit. Seems the weather wasn’t as good with him inland, and the snow I could see in the distance was probably where he was! I heard GM4CCN calling CQ and tried to answer but the Aberdeen folk thought I was calling CQ and called me back. Made a couple of contacts on the telescopic RH770 with the new FT-65 before setting up the slim G off to the side.</p>

<p>There were quite a few folks on the summit so I was over to the west side. Not sure if that was the best as I was in the shadow of the cairn and perhaps they might’ve been blocking my signal. I heard GM4CCN a few more times and we tried to have a QSO. I found holding the PTT on the FT65 difficult when my hands were getting cold, that I don’t think I was actually transmitting and so we never made the QSO. Bill, GM0NRT, kept saying I dropped out but I think it was not holding the PTT. I was probably holding it wrong, in my right hand and using my finger on the PTT, vs.&nbsp;my left and using my thumb. Or I should’ve put on a glove.</p>

<p>I tried the slim G for a bit, had a couple more but not as many as I thought I’d get on this summit. I switched to HF with the 5.5m vertical and tried 20m. A good reply on 20m with 16 in the log. I did try 10m for a bit. I heard a VK station absolutely booming in, who was talking to a MW0 station in Wales, but only one reply to my CQ. By this time I was getting cold and I’d been on the summit an hour, and should probably be getting back.</p>

<p>As I was packing up a lady, who I’d passed on my bike, asked me to take a photo of her. She also asked if I was a Russian spy. I said a good spy wouldn’t reveal if they were one - but also that could be double bluffing. We ended up walking back down together until I got to my bike. She was trying to complete all the Munros, and had about 20-odd left. I thought about making my excuses and running ahead but it was nice having a little chat and she wasn’t really any slower than me.</p>
<p>The bike ride back was easier as slightly downhill, so only took 20 minutes, and I was back at the car in no time, and home with 30 minutes to spare! Although only 12% battery in the car. The journey out had used 51% of the battery, which was slightly worrying but I suspect it was the colder morning, and now it was 15 C.</p>

<p>Sunday and a busy day for the kids planned, however, it did mean my eldest and I were free all morning. She’d enjoyed our <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-068/">last SOTA activation</a> and this time I wanted to try somewhere further afield, and do more than a one-pointer! Especially after my mid-week three summits trip.</p>

<p>We drove to the Lecht ski centre through thick fog and mist (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_(fog)">haar</a>) for about an hour. I’d looked at the forecast and it was meant to be partially sunny, but I was wondering if it had changed but I’d not seen it. However, with about 20 minutes to go, it suddenly cleared up and when we reached the car park it was a lovely day. This significantly helped the trip as I’m not sure my hiking partner would’ve been too pleased other wise! She immediately commented that the first path looked steep. She wasn’t wrong, it was the steepest part of the journey, although later on, on the way back, it was taxing again.</p>

<p>You walk around the lifts and towards another summit before descending and then ascending again to the final summit. Alone, and determined, I reckon I could do it in 45 minutes, but today it took us 1:15, with a couple of stops to sit down for a bit.</p>

<p>Annoyingly my Kenwood D72 wouldn’t turn on. It had died on Foudland during the week and I assumed it was just flat. I’d charged it and the charging light had turned green so I assumed all was good. Well no, it wasn’t. I tried fiddling with the battery clip to get it out but couldn’t work the mechanism and soon gave up on it. I had an old TH-79 with me which did turn on (although the LCD screen doesn’t show all the segments and is difficult to read). I have tested the TH-79 at home and it transmitted, but no-one could hear me and I wasn’t sure if it was really working.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to spend too long faffing about as the summit is very exposed, and whilst it was a nice day, my daughter would soon get cold just sitting around. So I switched to HF. I debated between the 5.5m random wire vertical or the 40m EFHW. I wanted to go on 40m and the random wire isn’t necessarily great for 40m. However, I should’ve just gone with the vertical. As I was rushing, it meant it took me ages to get setup as things kept going wrong. Eventually I was sorted, but then the challenge of finding a free frequency. Seemed to be a contest going on, bunkers on the air and all sorts, but I did manage. Got 5 on 40m, including two locals from the SOTA Whatsapp group and that meant success! I thought I’d quickly try 20m. I heard one faint German station but when I looked up the cloud had come right in and we were sat in it. I knew it was time to go, and so we quickly packed up and started heading down. A summit in the cloud is disorientating and cold.</p>

<p>We headed back down, and wanted to cut off part of the path up to the first summit, and follow the contours around. We were sort of successful but did get caught up in the bog and ended up walking a bit further downhill than we should’ve. Again, the cloud level didn’t help. It was a big of a struggle to get back on to the path at the top of the ski runs but we made it, and then it was an easy downhill from there.</p>
<p>Quite the change when we got to the bottom, the nice view at the start of this post was replaced by white cloud!</p>

<p>I’m glad we arrived when we did, else it would’ve been quite miserable and the only excitement of the radio activation wouldn’t have been shared by all!</p>
<p>We stopped at the Spar in <a href="https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/strathdon/bellabeg/index.html">Bellabeg</a> for some diet coke and a jam swiss roll, which we ate nearly half each before driving home.</p>
<p>There are a few more 4 pointers in the area, and hopefully I can get back to do some of those. Most have been activated less than 10 times, which suggests they’re maybe not that exciting or easy to get to. <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-023">Brown Cow Hill</a>, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-036">Geallaig</a>, and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-034">Mona Gowan</a> don’t seem too bad, so perhaps I should try those first.</p>
<p>When I got home I checked the D72. It wouldn’t turn on, but when I plugged in an external power supply it turned on and then worked fine on battery. I don’t like the reliability of this, and being caught out on a summit again. I might get a new battery pack but I also might look for another HT. Perhaps a Yeasu FT-65 etc. that has great battery life is just a simple HT.</p>

  <title>Building a portable 2m yagi</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been enjoying activating SOTA summits on 2m, and after visiting <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-012/">Glas Maol</a> and seeing how far I could get with an omni directional antenna, and watching videos of people using a 2m yagi to get into England from the highlands, I wanted to build a yagi.</p>
<p>All my research pointed me towards <a href="https://www.qsl.net/dk7zb/start1.htm">DK7ZB’s</a> designs, specifically the <a href="https://www.qsl.net/dk7zb/PVC-Yagis/PVC-details.htm">lightweight ones</a>. I decided the 4 element design with a 1m boom was optimal between gain and practicalities. This has a gain of 7 dBd and a front to back ratio of 12 dB. It also has the advantage of being able to use it with 70 cms.</p>

</div>
<p>I went to B&amp;Q and bought some 22mm PVC pipe, some wall clips, 4mm aluminium rods, and a 6mm aluminium tube. I already had some electrical connector blocks and RG58 cable at home. I made the boom a little longer than 1m, so I could hand hold it if I wanted to, otherwise it only needs to be 1m in length.</p>

<p><a href="https://vk1nam.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/antenna-project-portable-2m-4el-dl6wu-yagi/">VK1AD’s post</a> on building a similar yagi helped me decide how to mount everything to the boom, and I set to cutting the aluminium rods and drilling the holes in the clamp. The directors are easy, as they just slide through the clamp as a single piece. The reflector is slightly longer than 1m which the rods come in, so I used the 6mm tube as a connector between two 4mm rods. Sounds good in theory but it’s tricky to get the rods into the tube - precision hammering needed.</p>

<p>The driven element used the connectors from inside an electrical connector block, zip tied and then glued into one of the clamps. I used some solder wick to attach the coax to and screwed the elements in on each side.</p>

<p>RG58 is a bit heavy but it’s all I had so would do. Whilst this was easy to build, it does mean the only way I can transport it is by unscrewing the elements. Not the best solution but I wanted to get it built vs.&nbsp;debating over other ways or buying more things. A common way others do it is with a box mounted on the boom and there’s a coax connector on it, so you can remove the box with driven element in one. My one has about 3-4m of coax on which is enough from the mast mounting position to having the radio on the ground underneath.</p>

<p>I marked the PVC tube with sharpie for the location of each clamp, together with numbers. I also put a mark in the centre of the rod on the directors so I could centre it if it moved about in the clamp. It’s all about 1m long and I found a thin bag to carry it in. It’s not the greatest but will do. I used bungees to tie it to the side of my backpack.</p>

<p>I’m using a SOTABeams <a href="https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/tactical-mini-compact-ultra-portable-6-m-19-6-ft-mast/">tactical mini</a> mast to support it. It’s 6m telescopic fibreglass pole that has more strength than my usual <a href="https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/carbon-6-ultra-light-6-m-19-6-ft-mast/">Carbon-6</a> mast. There are two conduit wall mounts attached to the boom, so the yagi can be mounted vertically or horizontally. It works well enough, although if I want to change polarisation I have to take the mast down and then put it up again. I could take out all the other sections I don’t need but if I’m only taking one mast on an activation I want the 6m in case I need to setup HF.</p>
<p>I 3D printed some guying rings and rope tensioners from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5616644">this design</a> and cut some cord to length for the mast. The 2nd lowest ring fitted perfectly on the bottom segment of the tactical mini.</p>

<p>First test was in the garden, listening to the 2m lunchtime net…so it received well enough.</p>
<p>The first outing was to <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-072">Cairn William</a>, where I’d set it up on the top. We’d arranged SSB activity on another summit, although that guy had to pull out, however, we’d also prepared the locals to listen out. I started with SSB and managed to make four contacts locally with it. I then flipped it to FM and made a few more. Including a nice summit to summit with Schiehallion, around 112 km away! I brought it out later in the day on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-079">Tillymorgan</a>, and managed a contact with Helmsdale, around 100 km to the north…whilst the yagi was pointing south! Turning it around turned me from a 53 and a 59 by the chaser</p>

<p>I’m pleased with the results and think it worked rather well! It wasn’t too tricky to setup and use in the field, nor heavy to carry. It takes a bit of getting used to the length of it, especially when walking through forests as I kept catching it on trees and causing them to dump all their water onto my back!</p>
<p>I think a different way to connect the coax and the driven element would improve it, and maybe a dedicated mast that was just the right length would be better.</p>
<p>I did find this design for a <a href="https://www.iz2uuf.net/wp/index.php/2013/04/06/100g-yagi/">100g yagi</a> that looks nice, and have saved a few links to 2m moxon’s. Not sure when or if I’ll make these, as I do like the convenience of the slim G. I also <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/754860-mast-clip-for-2m-slim-g-antenna-for-sota-use-espec">printed a clip</a> for it, so it doesn’t flap around in the breeze.</p>

<p>A quick drive across the A96 and I was parked by the old church - <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pah11Z7VKxTnonEh7">Kirkton of Culsalmond Old Parish Church</a>. The path is easy, straight up the road to the turbines and then either around them bypassing the fence, or past them and then finding a spot where the barbed wire fence has come down.</p>

<p>Doesn’t take long and you’re in the activation zone, but I wanted to get to the trig point. Turns out there’s an old quarry here and you have to navigate it, but the trig offers lovely views all around once you do get there.</p>

<p>Decided to setup the yagi again and try it out, just on FM this time. The wind blew it around a little which caused signal reports to jump up and down. Managed across the water to the North to Helmsdale, about 100 km away…from the back of the yagi! I was 53 at first but when I turned it around I was 59 to him.</p>

<p>Just managed four in the log but that was enough, starting to feel the days activities now and it was time to be heading home. My shoes hadn’t done well on Cairn William, and were soaked back then, and still wet now.</p>

<p>This was the first summit I tested my <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/building-a-2m-portable-yagi/">new 2m yagi</a> on. I was pleased with the summit to summit with Schiehallion around 112 km away.</p>
<p>I parked in a lay by just <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vJktHhqjE538fz6N6">here</a>, and walked up several mountain bike trails.</p>
<p><a href="route.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-072/route.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>The first part was pretty muddy, but once up on the forestry track and beyond it was fine. It was a nice day if you looked south, but not so much to the north. The summit was in the clouds and somewhat damp.</p>

<p>The track is fairly easy to follow, just make sure to turn off the roadway on to the path, and the no entry signs are because the route is intended for mountain bikers.</p>

<p>Was fairly light breeze on the summit but nothing too bad, so it wasn’t hard setting up the mast with the guys. They do get tangled somewhat so I might look at alternatives.</p>

<p>Spoke to a couple of locals on the HT, once I was within the activation zone, and then setup the yagi for SSB. Managed 4 on sideband - a first for me - and 2M0RVZ had his first 2m sideband as well. Both of us using the ic-705. I think Chris just used the RH-770 for his antenna on the radio!</p>

<p>I let Bill, GM0NRT, know I was going up some other hills later that day, so he was going to keep an ear out for me.</p>
<p>As I was packing up I met G0JSO (although now GM0JSO as he’s moved locally) and we had a nice long chat about amateur radio. He’s not been on the air in ages and was asking lots of questions. I sent him an email when I got home, and hopefully we will hear him on the air soon. It would be good to add him to the local SOTA chat for activator and chaser…but will see what happens.</p>
<p>Off to the next summit!</p>
