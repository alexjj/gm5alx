<p>Continuing my journey from <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-005/">Beinn Mheadoin</a>…</p>
<p>It was pretty much downhill and then back up. It was now about 1230 and I was a little behind schedule, but enjoying the sun and rainbows. I looked back over to Mheadoin and, typically, now it was in the sun too!</p>

<p>The climb up Beinn a’Chaorainn starts quite steep with loose gravel but soon turns into a nice climb, aside from the boulder patch, but you can mostly work around it. As I got higher the wind picked up again. The summit cairn didn’t look very impressive, but actually offered decent shelter and I was quite comfortable behind it.</p>

<p>This time I tried 20m and the band was much more enjoyable, with a strong signal everywhere between south of England and Greece around 1,700 miles away.</p>
<p>Denis, MM0CBC on holiday from Wales, was on his way up Ben Tinnes, GM/ES-021, and by the time I was done with HF he was just setting up there, so we had a nice 2m S2S.</p>
<p>It was 1345 and I really needed to be back at Linn of Dee by 1530, to get home in time, so after getting distracted taking more photos, I hot stepped it back down and retrieved my bike. A reasonable number of other cyclists and hikers out, I didn’t meet any on the summits but along the main routes. It seemed now was the best weather of the day and plnety to enjoy as I cycled back.</p>

<p>Back at Linn of Dee at exactly 1530, and then the 1.5 hours drive back to Aberdeen. There was a huge moon and the road back to Braemar offered some lovely views of the moon between the trees and hills, together with the start of the sunsetting, my potato photo doesn’t do it justice.</p>

<p>Another big trip, probably the last of this year, unless there’s a December heat wave, and two infrequently visited and activated summits. It’s hard not to be biased by the weather but Beinn a’Chaorainn was my favourite today. When the clouds cleared I could see over to Beinn a’Bhuird area, down to Beinn Bhreac and big sweeping expanses of hillsides. It would’ve been nice to have been on Beinn Mheadhoin when the cloud lifted to see across to the west, and probably that would’ve been more spectacular. I’ll be revisiting them both next year, hopefully finding a day with clear blue skies! 🌞</p>

<p>The weather has been lovely up here all week - next week, however less so…</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="weather.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Mountain Forecast"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-005/weather.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Mountain Forecast"></a></p>

</div>
<p>So I wanted to make the most of it, and took today off. Monday or Tuesday were better days but alas I couldn’t make that happen. As you can see the forecast was meant to be lovely clear skies and maybe some cloud creeping in later. Well it was the opposite, with the best weather as I was cycling back…oh well. Here we go:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>Last week I did <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-001/">GM/ES-001</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-013/">GM/ES-013</a> on a big bike and hike, and today would be similar. I had debated between Cairn Toul + Braeriach and the two summits today, but everyone told me Cairn Toul circuit was too much, and save that for a summer’s day (or maybe camp in the Corrour bothy at the bottom). They’d all done the route so I should probably listen…and eventually I did. I’m glad, because it would’ve been too long, and the weather wasn’t the best - particularly the wind - and so that wouldn’t have been enjoyable.</p>

<p>Starting at Linn of Dee car park, around 0830, I cycled on the nice track to Derry Lodge. Here my route would take me east following the Derry Burn up Glen Derry. This section of the track is not great for cycling on, lots of roots, rocks, narrow sections with overhanging heather. It was slow going, much slower than I planned. Once you get to the next bridge and a few 10s metres along it’s much better. Some maps show an ATV track that runs somewhat parallel to this route. I didn’t see the start of it, but wondered if it would be better. Near the bridge you see it, and I did try it on the way back but it was very boggy, muddy and wet, and quick to disappear, so I just stuck to what I knew. The return run is less bad, as at least you’re generally going downhill.</p>

<p>The cycling continues along the track, and once you pass the final wooded area it starts to become rocky and difficult again. I started pushing my bike through the bad sections but they just became more and more, and it wouldn’t save time as I’d have to push it on the way back. So I dumped the bike in the heather and continued up to the Y junction.</p>

<p>It was about 09:40, so 1-1:10 of cycling. My route was left at the Y, following the Coire Etchachan burn, past Hutchison Memorial hut and to the shores of little loch Etchachan.</p>

<p>I had a peak inside the bothy and looked through the visitors book. Always interesting the little odds and ends people have left for others. Actually my first time in a bothy, would be fun one time…as long as I remembered to bring firewood!</p>

<p>Now the climb really started, and this brought the wind with it. It was relentless, reaching the peak at the top by the Loch.</p>
<p>I’d hoped the wind was just strong in the valley, and coming off the loch and that the summit would be better. Perhaps hoping in vain of course. The weather was not the clear skies forecast but very grey clouds, that I was about to be walking through. Not sure if it was raining or the wind just pushing huge volumes of air against me and the resultant water condensing made it seem like it was raining, but I was pretty wet all over.</p>

<p>Eventually a tor appeared out of the cloud and I thought I’d made it…looking at my map I realised it wasn’t and I still had some way to go. The next one appeared and I climbed up on top, but that was pushing it in the wind, and so I decided not to climb anymore. I thought the tors would shelter me from the wind but it seemed to come around from every direction and there was nowhere sheltered. I setup the mast and long wire, as I planned to start with 40m. I had the wrong guy ring for the carbon 6 and so it kept sliding all the way down, plus the peg into the wind kept lifting. I ended up putting three of the guys into the wind, plus pegging down the wire into the wind and it reached some equilibrium and held in place. It did remind me of the wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men.</p>

</div>
<p>40m wasn’t great, lots of QSB and I didn’t hang around long. Time for summit #2. Packed up and headed down into the Lairig an Laoigh. The sun was starting to peak through and once I was on the descent the wind abated. I took quite a direct route down, which was very steep and probably not the best route, although not sure where would’ve been better.</p>
<p>Also posted on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/beinn-mheadhoin-gm-es-005-and-beinn-achaorainn-gm-es-011/36785">SOTA reflector.</a> Following the discussion there, it turns out my route from Derry Lodge was not the best one when cycling. In fact, not crossing the Derry Burn at the lodge and continuing on the east side until I got to the foot bridge would’ve been a better cycle path - oh well, I know for next time!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I had originally planned to do Ben Tirran, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-016">GM/ES-016</a>, with Hunt Hill, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-042">GM/ES-042</a>, starting from Loch Lee and going back and forth, but I had to do the school pick up so needed to be home by 3pm. For a while I still thought I could do both until I realised my time spreadsheet had an error, although it took writing an email to someone saying I was going to be on Ben Tirran at 2pm…and then home by 3pm :thinking: Anyway, I decided to just do Ben Tirran as it’s taller…(only if it were 4m taller still…)</p>

<p>Perhaps on a clear day it would be more obvious, and the small cairn would stand out.</p>
<p>As I reached the summit, it was getting brighter, and I had hopes of the sun breaking through. I setup on 2m with the FT65 and RH770 and called a few times. Soon enough I had five contacts, including G6BIA down by Newcastle - who I also got on Mount Battock the other week.</p>

<p>Also out was Denis, MM0CBC, up on holiday from Wales. He was on <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-027">GM/ES-027</a> and we had a nice summit to summit on 2m. Also impressive given the high peaks of Lochnagar, and Beinn a’Bhuird were between us.</p>
<p>Several people reported my audio kept dropping and I was difficult to hear, but the carrier was still strong. Think I’ve come to the conclusion the FT-65 mic/design isn’t that great (judging from commentary online) and even though I’m right next to it when talking, small movements cause the levels to drop. That sounded annoying for those at the other end, especially after I’d witter on for 3 minutes and they only heard every 5th word.</p>

<p>I setup for 40m and had plenty of contacts. I’d arrived at the summit sooner than I expected, and so could afford to spend more time on the radio. I tried chasing a few other summits, although not too many active at the time, but made contact with HB9CYX and @DG4SFF. Tried a little 10m, and was rewarded with W4GO and N2BTD on the east of the US. I thought about changing from my sloper L antenna to a vertical but then realised I didn’t have enough time for that. Packing up I heard someone calling on 2m and ended up having a chat with a few others. At this point I was now behind schedule and had to get a move on! Back into the cloud and a quick trot down to the car.</p>

<p>A very enjoyable day out. It’s a nice summit, with good take off for 2m, some shelter at the trig, and lovely views when the cloud clears. I could see many summits peaking above the clouds - Mount Keen, Lochnagar, and even across to Ben Avon. On a cloudless day, I bet the views would be stunning all round.</p>
<p>It’s almost been two years since anyone came here, <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-all-88-out-of-87-uniques-activated/31625">Fraser being the last of course 2</a>. Perhaps the route from either north or south isn’t great, and there are plenty of other options closer from both sides. However, it would be one I’d recommend. I did get Tim, G5OLD, on 40m and so now he’s compelled to come up for a complete.</p>

<p>Ben Macdui is Scotland’s (and the UK’s) second highest mountain at 1,309 m, only beaten by 36m by the famous Ben Nevis. My journey continues from <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-013/">Carn A’ Mhaim</a>, whereby I walked along the ridge, then down (unfortunately) to the side of Ben Macdui. I’d caught up with the lady who passed me at the previous summit, and so we ended up walking to the summit of Ben Macdui together. She was visiting from Manchester and staying a few days in Braemar. She asked lots of questions about amateur radio and seemed interested, particularly in SOTA. Once we started going back up the hill it was just boulders for as far as the eye can see - although we were once again in the cloud so not that far.</p>

<p>The path came and went a few times as we went up, occasionally small patches of red sandstone gravel could be spotted, and we followed that as best we could. We came to a small stream to cross and that meant we were nearing the top, and the boulders eased off. Soon enough the trig point and cairn appeared in the cloud and we’d made it!</p>

<p>There were a few other people at the top, and a trickle of walkers continued for most of the time I was there. I looked around and found another sheltered cairn to setup behind. There wasn’t much wind at the top, but being in the cloud was a bit damp. Water would condense on the mast and wires and then drip down onto me (and radio if I wasn’t careful).</p>

<p>I had hoped 2m would be good from up here, certainly during the <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-087/">145 Alive event</a>, Fraser made contacts all over Scotland and north England. However, after Fraser and calling CQ a few times it seemed no-one was listening and I went to 40m - I also knew I had a long way back to go and didn’t want to hang about too long. 40m was good, with 13 contacts, including a summit to summit with 2W0OMX on GW/SW-001 - the tallest Brecon Beacon in Wales. As I was thinking of packing up I heard a mobile station call on 2m, and had a brief chat with him. I’d been on the air for about 30 minutes and it was time to pack up and head down.</p>

<p>The lady (who I never asked her name) who climbed with me had gone on to do the big loop around Derry Cairngorm and back to Derry Lodge. I’d looked at that route but it would add at least 30 minutes, and I was on a schedule to get home for 5pm, so I’ll save that Munro for next year. A bit of wandering around and I found my route down, and after not very long the clouds started to part and the views improved considerably!</p>

<p>I soon found the path in the photo above, and then it was plain sailing from there. It did get quite steep in places on the way down but manageable. The cloud had cleared more in the glen too, so looking back the mountainsides were impressive to see.</p>

<p>My route back to my bike made me realise I didn’t want to leave my bike right by the bridge as now I had to go down to get it. Going down was easy enough but then getting my bike back was a pain. I decided to carry my bike back up to the top path but this was a mistake as the path was narrow, rocky and difficult to cycle. I should’ve kept it to the middle path. If I do this route again, I might even leave the bike at the start of the trees and just walk. It would mean crossing the burn at the ford, and risk getting wet at the start of the journey!</p>
<p>Back on the reasonable path towards Derry Lodge, navigating the bog and mud again before crossing the bridge - that’s slightly too narrow to easily push my bike over! I was washing the mud off my wheels in the stream when the lady I’d met earlier was crossing the bridge! Seems like my estimate of 30 minutes extra for the Derry Cairngorm route was about right as that’s how long I was on the radio for, so good to know for next time.</p>

<p>The cycle from Derry Lodge back to Linn of Dee car park is very easy, although I’d not be wanting to walk all that way! I was back home by 5pm, just in time to take the boys for their haircuts!</p>

<p>After the lovely weekend’s weather, I was watching the forecast and today’s was looking good, so I decided to take the day off work and go for a big trip in the Cairngorms. Unfortunately, by the time it got to today, the weather wasn’t quite as nice as originally forecast. It was mild though, 12 degC at the Linn of Dee when I set off in the morning.</p>

<p>I started at Linn of Dee, and cycled along the nice track to Derry Lodge, a now boarded up hunting lodge. It’s common for people to leave their bikes here as the paths beyond aren’t quite as nice, or people are doing the big loop around Derry Cairngorm, Ben Macdui and back, and this is where all the paths return to. My route today did have a loop but not as big, and I continued to cycle on to Luibeg burn.</p>

</div>
<p>After crossing the bridge, the ground soon beomes very muddy and boggy, with the bike wheels disappearing half way into the mud. It was hard work finding a path across, but once that was done the track was reasonable again. There were some surface drains across the path but they were wide and easy to cycle over, but as I neared Luibed these became more rocky and less navigable whilst cycling. I reached Luibeg and wanted to leave my bike near the bridge, as this would be where I’d be coming on the way back.</p>

</div>
<p>There are actually three routes from east to west from when you meet the trees at Luibeg. I’d planned to take the upper route, ended up on the lower route, and found that the middle one would’ve been best! I ended up trying to get my bike through the woods on a tiny track, with rocks and roots and all sorts. It was not easy, but I eventually made it to the bridge. I left my bike there, crossed the bridge and walked down to rejoin the path before taking the northern split to ascent Carn a Mhaim. As I was walking up I realised I’d lost my LoRa tracker somewhere in those woods. It was on the top of my bag and the trees must’ve knocked it off. 😢 It wasn’t on as there are no igates nearby and I’m in the valley, so it’s not like I can even track the tracker!</p>

<p>Then out of the mist the summit cairn appeared and I setup for my first activation of the day. I’d hoped to qualify the summit on 2m, so I could get moving, but being mid-week I wasn’t hopeful. I did get three 2m QSOs fairly quickly, and then set up the quick 5.5m vertical for 20m. Contacts came in quick with that and then I thought I heard Bill, GM0NRT, call on 20m but I think it was on the HT still and then in my confusion the chasers stopped. However, I had enough contacts so just packed up. As I was doing so, Denis, MM0CBC, was out on a summit further west near Aviemore and he’d just reached the top. We had a tricky QSO as Bill thought I was speaking to him still on 2m, he struggled to hear me but heard me asking Denis to QSY, again thinking it was me asking Bill to QSY! Denis couldn’t hear Bill so it was probably confusing for him too but we made it in the end. As I was chatting with Denis, a lady came by to the summit. She was curious as to what I was doing and we had a brief chat. She then left and continued up to Ben Macdui. I packed up and started towards it myself.</p>

<p>The path that continues towards Ben Macdui follows the ridge between the two glens until it gets to the side of the mountain. This is quite a narrow ridge, but thankfully the wind was gentle. The clouds did start to part and I had a few glimpses down into Lairig Ghru, including Corrour bothy at the foot of Cairn Toul and Devil’s Point climb.</p>

  <title>Geallaig Hill</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My auntie was visiting for the weekend and she’s a keen hill walker, so of course we had to go out! I picked Gaellaig Hill as it’s not too long, and close to Ballater for a nice lunch afterwards and then still home in time to do school pick up.</p>
<p>Whilst yesterday the weather was lovely, and the forecast looked great over the weekend, today was much greyer and wetter. Thankfully it had stopped raining by the time we reached the start, and even a little blue sky appeared.</p>

<p>The walk up was straight forward, following the track right to the summit. I forgot to take any photos of the summit, but there’s a nice cairn you have to climb into with the trig point, and you’re very well protected from any wind. The rain less so, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Whilst the radio is somewhat of a novelty for her, I didn’t think that would last long. Fraser, MM0EFI, knew I was going up and we had a quick QSO on 2m, but then I jumped straight to 20m on HF. It was quite a considerable pile up and I really struggled to make anyone out. There was some QRM, tuning, tones that kept sounding too which made it harder. Probably if I had headphones on I would’ve done better but I at least wanted auntie to be able to hear.</p>

</div>
<p>Had a few England and Welsh stations come back who were booming signals, and cut through the pile up! Quite the short skip on 20m. Managed three summit-to-summits in England, Italy and Germany too.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, it was time to pack up and head back down…and warm up again! We went into Ballater - the first time I’ve actually been there! - had lunch at The Bothy and had a look around a few shops. Some classic granny shops on the high street!</p>

<p>This is the most the most easterly Corbett, which make it the most easterly mountain in Scotland. The weather was absolutely lovely, although the forecast for the summit was high winds.</p>

<p>The route was a long cycle, around 1:30, including pushing it up much of the steep parts to have a quick journey home. The path is very well made up the whole way, but you just have to watch you take the right turns at a few locations.</p>

<p>I dropped my bike at the turn off to the summit. As I approached the summit the wind was picking up considerably, I could also smell and see a lot of smoke in the air. Seemed to be some fires to the south, but at times the wind would blow great clouds of it towards me and it were as if I was right to a bonfire.</p>

<p>This is a good summit for 2m, I think Fraser has done a 145 Alive event from here, and from looking at past logs on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-032">sotlas</a>, so I was hoping for a quick activation on 2m. It wasn’t quite as quick as I’d hoped, but also turned out my spot didn’t really work properly, and showed as Test, due to the changes to the SOTA API and SOTAGoat not being updated.</p>

<p>However, my first CQ, with just the RH-770 telescopic antenna on, was immediately replied by G6BIA from South Shields, outside Newcastle, at 235 km/146 miles away! Great signal! It took another 30 minutes to get the 3 more needed to qualify and then one more from Hibby, MM0RFN, who met Fraser, MM0EFI, for lunch in Westhill.</p>

<p>Some good shelter on the summit - thank goodness - but also lots of fences and posts for future antenna mounting options! A good summit to spend the day if the weather co-operates.</p>

<p>Descent was quick, thanks to pushing the bike up so much of the ascent. Some parts were a bit hairy - steep, loose gravel and gusty winds, but once I was a little lower it was some nice free wheeling much of the way. It’s also a nice close summit, only being about 30 minutes drive from my house.</p>

<p>The kids have been enjoying the <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-077/">previous</a> <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-087/">adventures</a> we’ve gone on, and wanted to go out again. Tim, GM5OLD, was going to be going up Sgor Mor but had hurt his knee on the descent of Morven, so called it off. I’d originally planned to go up Craigendarroch, as that’s likely to be in reach, via 2m, of Sgor Mor, but as we weren’t constrained by that anymore, I decided Fourman Hill would be a good summit. It’s quite a low summit and the route up is short, around 1.3 km with 115m of elevation change. Makes for a nice pleasant walk, also when you’re carrying a tent, lunch for four and various things the kids want, you appreciate the short trip! If I was on my own, it would’ve only taken 20 minutes to get to the top.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should’ve done it that day I did <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-071/">three 1-pointers</a> in the area - then I could’ve used Mike’s, 2M0WNA, joke about being a four hill man.</p>

<p>Weather was good today, nearly clear blue skies, although some wind, particularly on the summit. The walk up is mostly sheltered by trees but when you near the top these are sparse and we were getting blown about quite a bit. The trig point is in the middle of some gorse and there’s not much space around it. We found a nearby tree in the heather to setup camp.</p>

<p>The kids kept out of the wind in the tent and had their lunch in there. I setup just behind a tree and used another to tie off the random wire in more of an inverter L shape rather than the usual inverted sloper L. I also had the slim G on the mast for 2m. Fraser, MM0EFI, was first in the log on 60m. I thought others would come but after about 10-15 minutes of calling, no-one else appeared so I moved to 40m. Whilst the CQ Worldwide DX Contest was going on, there was still space on the band and I worked 5 stations - including Tim, GM5OLD, from his camper van across at Glenshee.</p>

<p>As the contest was on, I thought I’d make the most of it and see what DX I could work. I moved to 10m and the band was chock-a-block! I started with a few European and Russian contacts, and they were easy to work. Everyone just gives you a 59 in a contest so not sure what my signal really was but when they come back after my first call and get my callsign correct, it must be a pretty decent signal. I saw Barbados, 8P5A, on the cluster, so thought I’d give them a try. It took a few attempts but eventually managed to get through! My first transatlantic SOTA QSO!</p>

<p>I switched the antenna to the 5.5m random vertical and started at 29.000 MHz and worked down. Lots of US stations at this end of the band and pretty much each one I tried, came back straight away. I heard many stations worldwide, Canada, Aruba, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, but didn’t manage to work them. It’s always a trade off of how long do you keep calling them before you decide they can’t hear you due to propagation vs.&nbsp;being drowned out by bigger stations. Plus the kids had had enough by this point and wanted to move on.</p>

<p>I did join the lunchtime net and made a couple of local contacts on 2m, I didn’t spot on 2m or try calling, as I wanted to spend the time on 10m instead. We were back to the car in 20 minutes and nearly everyone fell asleep on the way home! A friend at work asked me about good walks for kids, and thanks to SOTA. I now have a long list of nice walks to recommend!</p>

  <title>Brown Cow Hill</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Tim, GM5OLD, is up in the area and doing a few summits. I took the opportunity (with kind support from the family…for the morning at least!) to be out at the same time for some S2S action. Tim was going up both Mona Gowan and Morven today, and so I picked a 4-pointer nearby - the very Scottish sounding, Brown Cow Hill.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>The route starts in the car park for Corgarff castle and takes a nice track up the hill. Weather was okay, some low cloud and the possibility of rain in the afternoon. Our rendezvous time was around 10-10:30am. After my previous epic journey up two high peaks, this felt like a walk in the park. There was almost no wind and that alone made it enjoyable.</p>

<p>I soon entered the cloud and visibility dropped considerably. This was fine whilst I was following the track but after a while it mostly disappears into the heather…and peat hags.</p>

<p>There must’ve been some serious water coming down as the channels carved by it were huge, I had to make quite a few detours to find crossable areas without having to scramble down a muddy cliff face. It was wet and boggy underfoot, and I had plenty of full foot submersions.</p>

<p>Near the top, I emerged from the cloud and could enjoy some of the scenery again. A very new looking fence seemed to cross across the path but luckily a gate was nearby, so I didn’t have to clamber over it. Being out of the mist, I was rewarded with some lovely views across to nearby summits, including <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/">Ben Avon</a> I recently did. There wasn’t any snow at the top of them any more, they were out of the cloud and probably enjoyed the minimal wind as I was. Today would’ve been a much better day to climb them! If I did have the whole day, it would’ve been good to try Ben Macdui or some of the other high peaks too.</p>

<p>I reached the summit about 10am and setup my mast with the slim G and sloper L random wire antenna. The complete lack of wind was so enjoyable, although I still managed not to fully extend the mast and it collapsed on me! I knew Tim was nearly at the top too, so once setup I just listened to the bands and had something to eat. Unfortunately, just at the moment the cloud came in and the lovely views disappeared - oh well!</p>

<p>I brought the G90 and 4Ah LiFePO4 battery today. I like the G90, it’s a bit heavier than the KX2, but as my first radio, I have a soft spot for it. It’s pretty capable, especially given the price, and 20W and a tuner than can match the 5.5m vertical random wire on 40m is pretty sweet. 20W over 10W probably makes no discernible difference, but I do like the little waterfall for finding quiet spots on the band. If I’m going on a long walk, and multiple summits, I’d probably stick with the KX2. If the weather is bad, I’d lean more to the KX2 also, as its form factor makes it easier to keep hidden from the rain in my shadow or a plastic bag. However, on a short walk, and nice weather, I’d probably take the G90, or if I just want a change.</p>

<p>I had some nice QSOs with Tim, GM5OLD, Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ, on 2m. I could hear Bill, GM0NRT, in Aberdeen about a 31, but he couldn’t hear me. Tim had Bill as a 59, but it seemed Mona Gowan/Morven were enough to block my signal. Tim and I had a nice chat for a while, on 145.500, but there’s no-one around here so it doesn’t matter 😅, and then we both went to HF. Plenty of contacts on 40m, in England, Ireland and into Europe. I hunted a few summit to summits, with a pair in Italy and one in Norway. I moved up to 10m, a band I’ve not tried much, usually as I’m in a rush and once the summit is qualified I’m off, and got several more stations in Europe and a couple into “Africa”, the Canary Islands, receiving 55 and 59 from them.</p>

</div>
<p>I was meant to be home by 1pm but I was having a blast on the air, and the weather was pleasant, so I ended up staying at the summit for much longer than I planned. However, I did have to get back, so I packed up and headed down. I tried walking a straight route from crossing the fence back to the main track, but managed to wind all over the place. There did seem to be fewer peat hags on the way back, although the few that there were, they were a lot steeper. I also managed to miss the turning on the track back to the castle and looked up to find the castle much higher than me, so then scrambled up the side of the slope to get back on the proper track. At this point it started to rain a little but I was nearly back to the car.</p>
<p>I’m only the 8th person to activate Brown Cow Hill. It’s clearly not a popular summit, and likely one for just those looking to complete GM/ES or other lists. There are plenty of other ones nearby that are more appealing. However, if the weather is clear, you get some stunning views all around, and the walk up isn’t that bad - around 6.6 km and 425m ascent, with minimal ups and downs - just the peat hags to deal with but other summits have those too. I still stand by that Morven is the worst summit for brutality of ascent!</p>
<p>Here’s Fraser at the other end of our 2m QSO.</p>

<p>After activating <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/">Ben Avon</a>, and a brief stop for some food, it was time to head back to The Sneck and then up to Beinn a’Bhuird.</p>

<p>The frozen burns were interesting, some I could walk over, and some were only partially frozen. The small waterfalls would trap air underneath and then the bubbles would travel under the ice for a few meters before escaping.</p>

<p>The summit was hard to find, my GPS route had come to an end but I couldn’t see anything. Some general blind amberling around eventually found it hidden in the cloud. I was a bit disappointed in the cairn, I was hoping I could at least hide in it, and even when crouched down behind it, the wind still got me.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to spend ages messing about, trying to get setup on HF, but nothing would stay still. The wind pulled out guys and pegs, it bent the top of mast over 90° and so wires would come off, I angled the mast 35° off the ground into the wind, and the top still bent over enough for the wire to be pulled off. I held the mast with my body weight but still the wind could pick me up with only the surface area of the mast! Just when I had everything set for 40m it all blew down :sweat_smile: I thought I’d try 2m but that was just as challenging. I could hear the local lunch time net in Aberdeen but it was hard to get a word in edgeways and I’m not sure they could hear me anyway. So back to HF it was, this time with a short 5.5m vertical random wire for 20m. This I did manage to make some contacts with but, again, the wind blew me and the mast over mid-way through a QSO. By this time I was fed up, cold and wet, but had qualified the summit, so it was time to go! Also, there was no signal just behind the cairn…to add to the fun.</p>

<p>I generally took the same route back, without a compass, or device with a compass, it would be impossible to know which way to go. At one point on the way back it was so windy I could lean into the wind and it would hold me up! But I was soon back at The Sneck and heading down, and it wasn’t long before the conditions were more pleasant again. The weather wasn’t quite so nice down in the valley on the way back, but much nicer than on the summits. Found my bike, generally took the same route back, and was pleased to arrive back at the car to drive home.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After a lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar trip</a> the other week (with the now amusing subtitle of windy munro), I was keen to do some more high summits before the weather got worse and the darkness set in. Although turns out the weather is already worse! It’s school holidays here, so with no family schedule constraints, I could go out for the whole day, and I decided to try these two big uns - Ben Avon and Beinn A’Bhuird, pronounced Ben Ann and Ben a Vour respectively.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="route.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Journey there and back"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-006/route.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Journey there and back"></a></p>

<p>The route is pretty standard for these two, parking at Keiloch, paying the £3.50, then cycling, before hiking. I decided to bike as far as I could towards The Sneck (the T junction between the two summits at 986m), and just retrace my steps from Beinn a’Bhuird back. This is instead of doing the loop where you walk from Beinn a’Bhuird North Top (the full summit name) to South Top across the plateau, then down the side and meet the path again after crossing Quoich Water. As I could see the low cloud I thought I’d rather not be walking that route for the first time, and just retrace my steps. Although given my “retracing” aka wildly veering route, and the completely indistinguishable terrain, it probably didn’t matter. It also meant more cycling on the way in, which helped my timing, for a chance of a good summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, on Mull.</p>

<p>The route in has a few parallel paths, including the Fairy Glen, and I’m not sure I took the best ones, and had to push the bike up some steep rocky parts in places. I tried the other way on the way back and it wasn’t much better, and then I missed the turn and went through the Fairy Glen - although didn’t see the secret howff (a hidden bothy), but also didn’t look very hard as I wanted to get back.</p>

<p>The weather was reasonable in the morning, patches of sun between the clouds and fairly mild for 8am. The forecast had the summits in cloud with strong winds, 30-40 mph with gusts of 50 mph. However, until I got to The Sneck, there was minimal wind, but boy, once I did! 🌬️ It was absolutely relentless, with my hood acting like a reed in a trumpet with an enthusiastic player. I gave the edge a wide berth, not trusting myself if there was a sudden gust that I wasn’t braced for. Snow was minimal on the way to the Ben Avon summit, with just small pockets that resisted being blown away.</p>

<p>Out of the mist the tor emerges and I have arrived! Peaking through the rock formation - which acted like the mouth piece of the trumpet - revealed more snow on that side.</p>

<p>I found a nice rock to hide behind and setup the slim G on the carbon mast. My last activation on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-030/">Carn a’Gheoidh</a>, suffered a lot from the mast bending too much in the wind and the antenna sliding off. Up until this point, I’d forgotten about this and so hadn’t prepared anything else. Luckily the slight sheltering seem to keep the antenna on and I managed to make my QSOs. The most exciting was a summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, who’s on Mull and was up <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SI-016">GM/SI-016</a>, 100 miles away. We were both on HTs and slim G antenna!</p>

<p>A pretty big sun CME hit and caused some lovely aurora all around the UK, however, this meant the bands were wrecked this morning. K of 7. Although dxheat was showing 40m activity in Europe this morning so I thought I’d try it. I had wanted to do some 20m to get a some nice EU contacts, as I thought that might be more interesting.</p>

<p>My mum is visiting and after all the sunny hillside photos I’ve been sending her, she wanted to come out and see the sights for herself. The weather wasn’t quite as spectacular as recent outings to <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">An Socach</a>, but it was nice enough. After we dropped the kids at school, we headed up. There’s a dedicated car park, Tap O’Noth car park, and a nice track all the way to the top, so it was a straight forward walk. My mum did have a stroke about 11 years ago, and that does limit her at times. I’d hoped this summit wouldn’t be too much for her. When you arrive you’re greeted with this huge lump that sticks out of the ground and looks imposing, I thought I took a photo but it appears not.</p>

<p>With a few stops on the way, we all made it to the top in good time. The cloud had come in a little and it was much windier but still decent weather. The top of this hill used to be a fort back in the Dark Ages, and so offers plenty of shelter from the wind.</p>

<p>I setup near the trig point in a nice recess in the side. I’d brought the G90 and my 5.5m vertical random wire. The G90 can match this tiny length of wire on any band, even 40m! Although probably longer wires would be better. I’d also brought my end fed half wave, but the 5.5m vertical is so fast to setup. As I was worried the novelty of watching me on the radio would wear off soon, and the cold wind would get to everyone, I stuck with this vertical. I gave 40m a shot, and did manage to just hear Phil, G4OBK. We were both 31 with each other. I then heard my HT as locals were chatting and asking if I’d already been and gone or what had happened. I’d emailed earlier in the day saying I was going up but had put 11am and we’d left later so it was closer to 11:30am.</p>

<p>I had the RH-770 on the HT and joined in the conversation, saying I was on the summit. Simon, GM4JXP, and Chris, 2M0RVZ, quickly called in and I was more than qualified. Simon was testing a new home made 5 el yagi and was absolutely deafening when he called! I tried one more CQ but I’d done the job so thought it was time I packed up and headed down - we didn’t want to be late for lunch! My mum liked the chats we all had on 2m, and said everyone sounded very friendly. If I had been on 20m or higher frequencies, it might’ve been exciting countries but nothing more than callsigns and RST exchanges.</p>

<p>The trip down was easy enough, we actually met a few other walkers on their way up, and we were back in the car heading to Alford to try out a cafe for lunch. Soup and sandwiches all round with a sense of accomplishment by all. A very enjoyable trip out. Tap O’Noth will be a good one to do during the Winter bonus period (30 Nov-14 Mar) to get 5 points from it! The shelter the old fort offers is very nice for keeping out of the cold winds!</p>

  <title>Getting started with Bunkers on the Air</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/bunkers-on-the-air/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve heard about it before but only just looked into bunkers on the air (or UK BOTA). Turns out there are a lot of sites around and good way to get out and about, use the radio, explore your local region and maybe learn a little bit of history.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of useful sites to get you going:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bunkersontheair.org/site/">Main site</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bunkerbase.org/">Database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bunkerbase.org/bunker-3/">Maps</a>
<ul>
<li>The Google Map didn’t appear for me, but the OS map is nice, or use the combined on below:</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://kwirk.github.io/pota-gb-map/">Combined awards map</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be within 1000 m of the bunker location (with the right permissions etc.)</li>
<li>Qualify the bunker with 25 HF contacts or 10 VHF+ contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d recommend joining the WhatsApp group listed on the website, and you’ll get invited to the spotting group too.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the number of bunkers locally to me, especailly compared to doing SOTA activations and having to drive at least an hour to get anywhere!</p>
<p>I’ve not activated one yet but there appear to be plenty that have never been done near me.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After a lovely day yesterday on Lochnagar and Conachcraig, I was looking to see where I could go today. There was a swimming competition on, in addition to the usual activities, so I needed to be back for 3pm. Last week when I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">An Socach</a>, the others went to Carn a’Gheoidh, and I remembered them leaving later than me but arriving at the top at the same time. Sure enough when I check all the times, it looked doable to get there and back in time. The longest part is the drive to Glenshee ski centre, and that’s right at the limit of the electric car - returning home with 20 miles range still makes me a little nervous!</p>

<p>The weather forecast had it cloudy with chance of showers and reasonably breezy. It did rain a little on the way out but was dry when I arrived. I wasted about 10 minutes getting a parking ticket from the cafe - I should’ve just opened the link in the car park when I was up the hill and had signal, like I did with Glas Maol.</p>

<p>The track follows up the ski maintenance tracks, which are quite steep to start. There’s a shortcut across part way up which I just walked right past. My Inreach mini started beeping as I’d gone of course and so I backtracked and found it. It was a small track at right angles to the main path just behind a fence, so not too obvious, so thanks to the Garmin!</p>

<p>I was soon in the cloud and did check on the inreach every so often to make sure I was heading in the right direction. I doesn’t have topo maps, and just a line but it has a compass and so points in the right direction and is enough to make sure you’re following the right path.</p>

<p>I didn’t see much on the way up, other than about 20m around me, mostly looking like the photo. In exposed places the wind picked up a lot and gave me a good push. At one point I was about 3m from a small loch and I didn’t realise until I was right upon it. The track was decent and only in a few places was it boggy but nothing like The Buck. The final ascent to the summit is steep again after a while of walking on the mostly flat plateau. At this point the wind was howling and I was glad there was a cairn at the top.</p>

<p>I setup behind the cairn, which was a very good shelter from the wind, had a sandwich and then got on the air. I thought I’d try a bit more power on 2m and see if I could get any further than usual. I’d brought the Kenwood V71 and battery. This is the first time I’ve taken it out with me, and I also haven’t used it much at home, so I was hoping I wouldn’t get into any operating issues with it! I had the slim G, and was glad I hadn’t brought the yagi to try and setup in the wind.</p>

<p>I now wonder if I’d setup the mast on the outside of the cairn pointing into the wind, if I could’ve made it more vertical. Particularly as right at the end the antenna got blown off and I ended up holding it with my arm to finish the QSO - I didn’t do an EMF assessment on that setup…</p>

<p>It was a little slow to start, but eventually I’d work 9 stations, including GM4OAS 90 miles to the west in Mallaig. I did find the lowest squelch on the V71 was quite high and not breaking for several stations. I eventually turned it off and then heard several locals and others. I do wonder how many had been replying to my CQs before. Did 50W make any difference? The map looks remarkably similar to when I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-012/">Glas Maol</a>, and that was with the 5W D72 handheld. Technically, it’s 10 dB which is 1.x S points, and on Glas Maol GM4OAS gave me 32 and this time he gave me 42, so whilst not more power, I was readable more? I do like the form factor of using the mobile rig with the fist mic, means I can position things easier than being tied directly to the end of the mast, but probably for the most part it makes no real difference and it’s all in my head!</p>

<p>Keeping an eye on the time, I needed to pack up and head back. The wind was still relentless and on the top I had to lean into it. I was grateful of my big hood as I followed the path back down. It’s amazing how you can forget some of the details of the walk on the way back, being surprised that I had to climb up and down a few places which I didn’t remember on the way up to the summit! For a few moments the wind seemed to blow the clouds away and there was even a hint of sunshine coming through. The view opened up and I could see all around. Certainly not the spectacular views of <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-038/">last week</a>, but enjoyable for the few moments. Back down to the car and back home.</p>

<p>I think this summit and Glas Maol would make a nice day trip out, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with the option of a hot lunch at the ski centre cafe. For 6 and 8 pointers, they have fairly easy and short walks, and both great locations for 2m, particularly to the south. Doing both would be 14 points, and a lot less walking and climbing than my 14 point day yesterday on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">Lochnagar</a> and <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-019/">Conachcraig</a>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been eyeing Lochnagar <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-008">GM/ES-008</a> for a while, and this Thursday’s forecast was looking reasonable, so decided to take the day off. It’s little neighbour, Conachcraig <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-019">GM/ES-019</a>, is asking to be activated at the same time. I was going to take the common route starting at Glenmuick, but Fraser, MM0EFI, suggested biking from Balmoral castle.</p>
<p>As I was trying to fit this into the family schedule, any time I could save would be an advantage. I used <a href="https://www.plotaroute.com/">plotaroute</a> to figure out the times for the biking and hiking sections, matching the speed I think I move at, plus the drive back and forth, it looked like the cycle route would be the quickest. 8:05 hrs for the cycle route vs.&nbsp;8:40 for the walk from Glenmuick (times include driving). I considered cycling from Glenmuick but supposedly the path isn’t great beyond the forest, so not really worth it.</p>
<p>Was only a few degrees at the start in Crathie car park, but cycling generally uphill and in the sun I was soon roasting! It was around 1:15 cycle up to the intersection of Lochnagar and Conachcraig and I’d had enough of the bike! Much of the route is a gentle incline but there are areas where it’s steeper and much less enjoyable.</p>

<p>I met a nice German couple on the way up Lochnagar. They’d been in Scotland for nearly 3 weeks and had brillant weather all round. Climbed Ben Nevis, Ben Lomond and visited several cities and towns.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Of course the weather is always like this”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A german ham I know told me: “Nice German” is as redundant as “false error” or “undead zombie”. His choice of words. Enough chit-chat, I had a schedule to keep and kept going.</p>

<p>I’ve not been on a popular summit for a while and was surprised to see so many people on a random Thursday. I say so many people, it probably it was about 15, but compared to zero to two, it seemed a lot.</p>
<p>The forecast had said cloudy in the afternoon and I was due on the summit at 1300 local so I was hoping it would stay clear. I wasn’t disappointed.</p>

<p>I waited my turn in the queue to take photos at the summit, offering to take those of others. The wind was strong at this point and you wanted to be sure of your footing whilst scrambling about on the top. The views were incredible in all directions, and anyone on a summit in GM/ES would’ve had a great day.</p>

<p>I’d made it to the top ahead of schedule but I spent a long time admiring the views and walking around. The wind was strong so I looked for somewhere sheltered and away from the main path to setup, but ended up just sitting on the grass to one side. With my back to the wind it wasn’t too bad. I setup the slim G on the 6m mast and used my HT to call CQ. I was hoping to qualify the summit on 2m and in short order to keep on my way. I also noticed the clouds rolling in from the south. Got 5 in the log, mostly the locals plus Jace MM7VXJ who called when I was eating a biscuit. Credit to Jace for trying to relay messages to Jack, GM4COX, who was a 59 for me but think I was a 01 for him, and he wanted to move to sideband. I was surprised not to get anyone else further south.</p>

<p>Time to head back. I should’ve taken a photo of Conachcraig from the summit, as it looked tiny from atop Lochnagar! All around the cliff edges are openings that just drop away, and on a lovely sunny day they’re interesting to look at but if it were cloudy these are a literal death trap!</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-008/">big hill</a>, it was time to do the small one - <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-019">Conachcraig</a>. It certainly looked small from Lochnagar summit but it’s still a respectable 865m tall.</p>

<p>It felt like a short, straight up route on a nice track. I turned and looked back at Lochnagar and could see the cloud hovering over the summit, although not submerging it.</p>

<p>The rock formations on Conachcraig are interesting to look at, I haven’t really got a good photo of them so you’ll have to go there yourself. Unsurprisingly, no-one else was at this summit with me and I ducked down behind a rock to keep out the wind whilst I setup again on 2m.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ for their contacts on both summits, then with Simon, GM4JXP, and finally Richie, GM1LKD, in Aberdeen I was set. It was now 3:05pm, and I needed to be home by 5pm, and with an hour+ drive, it was time to pack up and head back to my bike.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/906901577214402/?locale=en_GB">145 Alive!</a> event was planned for today between 1-3pm, which I wanted to join in with. Should be the perfect time to activate a summit on 2m! I had the three little kids with me for the day, so it had to be a easy summit. Particularly as I wanted to bring up the tent and lunch and things for them, to keep them entertained whilst I was on the air. The previous times I’ve brought them, I’ve only been about 20 minutes at most and trying to go much longer would be tricky. Eventually I want to qualify all the GM/ES summits, and so Waughton hill is on my list. It’s quite out of the way with nothing else nearby, so it’s a trip in itself and for one point, I’m not wasting a day off on it! It’s also the lowest summit in GM/ES, and seemed perfect for our adventure.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>The path up is short, although does cross a field full of cows, and you soon find yourself by the white horse. Walk by its head and you’re on the top of the rise, and heading towards the old hunter’s cottage. The actual summit is a bit further away, requiring you to go down and up the side of the hill again. However, the hunter’s cottage is in the activation zone and the kids thought we’d reached the top and started playing in the house. There was also a nice piece of grass without any sheep or animal droppings on it for the tent I’d brought. The tent and mast went up easily enough and lunch and various toys were unloaded into the tent. It was about 12:55 and I wanted to be on the air for the start of the event, so I swallowed down my rolls and setup the IC-705. Turns out the coax on the slim G with the 6m tactical mini mast is just a little too short for the radio to be on the ground. I usually don’t notice as either using the carbon 6, where the antenna sits a little lower on it, or a HT which I’m holding at standing height. So I ended up having to hold the 705 in my hand the whole time.</p>

<p>I’ve not long had the IC-705 and whilst it is very simple to use, sometimes I get into some modes or settings that I don’t know how to get out of. Today I was already on 2m FM but would the VFO change the frequency? No.&nbsp;First I was worried I’d bashed it in my bag and the dial was broken, then thought perhaps I’d selected 10 or 100 Hz increment but that didn’t seem to matter. I ended up just pressing stuff and then going to band and choosing 144 MHz again seemed to fix it. Phew!</p>

<p>It was nice having the waterfall to see is there was any activity and there certainly was some! I knew MM0EFI and MM0RFN were going up Ben Macdui and Glas Maol respectively, but not sure if they’d got to the summit in time. Fraser was supposed to be on 145.250, so I tuned to it and heard Bill, GM0NRT, talking to someone but couldn’t hear the other end. I was worried I couldn’t hear Fraser on Ben Macdui, but turned out was just someone else. Tuning around, I heard a guy down at the car park by <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-085/">Hill of Garvock</a> and ended up qualifying the summit with those on his net. I managed to work four summit to summits, two on Ben Macdui, Glas Maol and then Morven. I heard a station down in East Lothian calling on 145.500 but he didn’t hear my reply. After about an hour, I had 10 QSOs and thought it was about time we packed up.</p>

<p>We headed back down, and went to <a href="https://adencountrypark.org.uk/">Aden Country Park</a> for some more fun. Turned out to be an old timey tractor fair and there were loads of them on the roads as we drove there.</p>
<p>Was a fun day all round, and nice to join in with this event. Maybe next time I’ll try for a higher summit!</p>
<p>The guys up Ben Macdui had a <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/carn-amhaim-gm-es-013-ben-macdui-gm-es-001-slightly-broken/36399">fun trip.</a>. Not jealous in the slightest…😅 Also afterwards, Chris, 2M0RVZ, was boasting about his points compared to mine…challenge accepted!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Fraser, MM0EFI, messaged asking who wanted to do a Munro midweek, and I thought it was a good opportunity to go. He also rallied Chris, 2M0RVZ, and Simon, GM4JXP. I decided to go up An Socach, whilst Fraser and Chris were going up Carn a’Gheoidh, and Simon on Glas Maol. A notice was posted on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/upcoming-2m-activity-wednesday-25th-september/36335/65">reflector</a>, and several others were keen to go up summits in Scotland and England. Later on we came to realise that the time posted on the reflector and Alerts was two hours late! Oops…no wonder no-one else turned up “at the right time”.</p>

<p>I got to the start around 7:45, and it was a chilly start, with -1.5 degC in Braemar as I drove through, however, the weather was stunning with clear blue skies and not a breath of wind.</p>
<p>I cycled along the estate track until the actual ascent starts - probably saves about 20-30 minutes walking each way, as I thought Fraser and Chris would have a quicker walk back on their summit. I need to buy an actual mountain bike as this and Mount Keen the other week have felt like I was going to shake the bike, and me, to pieces. The bike made a helpful support when crossing the ford before turning up the hill.</p>

<p>The first cairn is only 6m below the actual summit but still around 2km away. At this point I called in with Fraser and Chris on the HT, and they were a similar 1.5km away from their summit.</p>

<p>Lots of good views and, as already said, lovely weather! I found a nice grassy patch near to the cairn to setup the yagi.</p>

<p>Some good QSOs on 2m FM and SSB, not quite what Fraser managed but his summit was higher and so he was in the way! 😅</p>

</div>
<p>After calling for a long time on sideband I was impatient on FM and kept jumping around when I saw activity on the waterfall, either following Fraser like an annoying puppy, or jumping onto the calling frequency when it was free. Probably should’ve just stayed still!</p>
<p>I made use of the flat plateau and large activation zone to start heading back but still ready with the HT for Alan, MM0VPM. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sota-goat/id590206108">SotaGoat</a> app kept me in check and that saved a bit of time coming back. My worries of being slow down were unnecessary as I ended up being at the Bothy for a full round of cakes before the others arrived…and I couldn’t let them feel guilty for eating in front of me.</p>
<p>G4IPB reported hearing me on from <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/G/LD-008">Blencathra</a> - in the lake district just north of Keswick - and after seeing his report I realised that I also heard him but we were in the middle of some other QSOs so I never followed up and changed frequency. I was only on the HT and RH770 but he’d give me 55 and he was clear to me, although the first QSO was a bit muffled and dogs barking made it unclear.</p>
<p>The views were spectacular all around, with snow on the high summits.</p>

  <title>Largo Law</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My wife and I had a trip away for the weekend, and I suggested a nice walk nearby…which of course was a SOTA summit! We were staying near St.&nbsp;Andrews, which is quite a flat area, however, there are a few granite lumps you can climb. Today’s one was Largo Law. If the weather was good, we’d have a lovely view of the Forth, Edinburgh and East Lothian. However, that wasn’t the case today…more like gray and cloudy.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="largolaw-4.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Summit ahead!"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-ss-259/largolaw-4.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Summit ahead!"></a></p>

</div>
<p>The route is straight forward, as shown on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-259">Sotlas</a>, park at the school/cemetery, up towards the farm and then straight up the hill! The track was tricky in places as the ground was dry and covered in loose soil, but we made it up fine.</p>

<p>I setup the slim g on the 6m carbon mast, put out a spot and called CQ. It took a few calls but stations did start coming back. Good coverage across Glasgow, Edinburgh and up to Montrose area. Had a nice chat with GM4PKJ, who lives very close to where we used to live around 10 years ago. His wife is a ham too, but I didn’t realise until I got home and looked him up on QRZ, otherwise I could’ve said hi to her too.</p>

<p>Got my four contacts and packed up. My wife was sat nearby and commented the radio conversation was so “old man”. It was mostly what’s the weather and setup but I probably do adopt some old man tendencies when talking…it’s as though you’ve got to fit in. I should just ignore that and say whatever I want. Although I do like describing the weather on a summit, as quite often it’s different from “ground” level.</p>

<p>I had my Lora tracker with me and looked up if I’d been tracked. Two stations across the water had followed me up and down the summit. One was a new one in the centre of Edinburgh owned by <a href="https://gm5aug.topple.scot/">GM5AUG</a>.</p>

  <title>The Buck</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Not wanting to waste a glorious day, I had time for a quick activation in the morning and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-039">The Buck</a> was the recommendation.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

</div>
<p>The route is pretty easy, not quite a straight line as I’ve drawn but I parked slightly east on the road and walked up until I met this fence line. A quick march and you can be at the top in 30 minutes. The sub-500m area is pretty boggy and wet, even today when it hasn’t rained in a while. It was a little slow in places, trying to avoid plunging my feet into ankle deep water. The path is also vague at this stage but then becomes more defined within about 1km of the summit.</p>

<p>The weather was amazing, brilliant sunshine, blue skies and not a breath of wind. I was roasting on the way up!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Trig point on top of the rocky summit</figcaption>

</div>
<p>Even at the top the wind was minimal, and I’ve never seen my carbon-6 stand so straight at a summit before! I made use of the nice clear hole in the trig point and put the mast in it with the slim g on top. I could see for miles and miles!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="buck-6.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5" title="Setup for 2m"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/buck-6.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Setup for 2m"></a></p>
<figcaption>Setup for 2m</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I was hoping it would be a quick activation on 2m, as I needed to get back home by lunchtime, and this summit would cover a huge area. Back from his hols in <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-sota-rough-guide-to-barbados/36296">Barbados</a>, MM0EFI was first in the log. After 5 minutes, Bill in Aberdeen, GM0NRT, called back, and whilst we were talking I heard another station call. This time it was GM0UDL up in Fortrose, just north of Inverness who had seen my Lora tracker being picked up by GM4SJB (even further north!). He told me about his lora setup and how everyone around that area has setup iGates and DMR repeaters. Sounds like a great setup they have. Not long afterwards my fourth 2m contact, needed to qualify the summit, came from GM8ZKU across to the east by the coast. Again, another nice QSO with Simon for the first time. Time was getting on and I did need to be back home, I tried on more CQ but then called it a day.</p>

<figcaption>Looking North</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>had a quick look around for the <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/aberdeenshire/the-buck.shtml">ancient engravings</a> but couldn’t find them. It was a quick walk back down the hill to the car. I’d forgotten about the sogginess but managed to escape with dry feet.</p>
<p>When I got home I looked up the Lora tracking on <a href="https://lora.ham-radio-op.net/">EA2RCF’s mapping page</a>, and was surprised to see just how far away GM4SJB’s receiving igate was! It had also tracked me nearly the whole route up and down, which I then realised was me walking the county boundaries. The power on the tracker is tiny and the antenna isn’t amazing but this time it all worked well. I’ve been carrying it with me on most summits but there haven’t been any igates nearby that have picked me up.</p>

<p>A nice quick 4-pointer summit - I’m beginning to think <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-018/">Morven</a> is a brutal 4-pointer! - although not for a wet day, or post a lot of rain. The summit is quite exposed, although maybe you could find some shelter depending on the wind direction. It’s a popular summit to do with Tap O’Noth, as that’s just a few miles away, however, I just didn’t have time on this occasion. Maybe they’ll be a good combo next year during the winter bonus period.</p>
