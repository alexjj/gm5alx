<p>After hearing that Alan, MM0VPM, was doing a <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-002-003-and-007/36165">tour of the Cairngorms</a>, the local SOTA group was listening out for him. I commented that no one had done <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-007">Beinn Bhrotain</a> for a long time, not even Fraser. His response was, ‚ÄúHow about Sunday, then?‚Äù The offer included transportation and a loan of a mountain bike, plus, of course, the guided tour‚Äîan offer too good to refuse! Free time on the weekends can be tricky, with several sets of kids‚Äô activities and potential birthday parties, so we needed to start early so I could be back in time for my wife to start her coaching session at the swim club. Fraser was good with that, and our rendezvous was at 6 a.m. in the Dinnet car park for the onward journey to the Linn of Dee.</p>

<p>We‚Äôd all seen a photo recently shared of the midge in the area, which is quite unusual away from the west of Scotland. Sure enough, there were plenty about when we arrived and unpacked the bikes. We met a DoE group packing up their tents at White Bridge, and they told tales of woe and suffering in the evening; the leader seemed very pleased to be going home. My wife later told me about one of her swimmers sending home a photo of a pan of custard he was cooking on his expedition, which had a nice layer of midges on top. ü§¢</p>

<p>The weather was pleasant enough, although the promised clear skies had yet to appear, and the cloud level was fairly low. We continued on our ride, following the Dee along a rockier track with plenty of culverts to negotiate. After around 7.5 km of cycling, we left the bikes by the side of the fence and took the track up towards the first summit we could just about see, Carn Cloich-mhuilinn. The path came and went, or we found and lost it several times, but with the rocky peak to aim for, it wasn‚Äôt too difficult to navigate. Every so often, Fraser would point out surrounding summits or features, complete with name, SOTA points, and YouTube URL, the names of which I‚Äôd immediately forget until he told them to me again on the way back down. The last 200m or so climb of this Carn was bouldery but nice underfoot, a bit like clambering across rocks at a beach. With the interim summit climbed, we admired the view. The cloud was still low, and a few patches of sun were appearing in the distance. It looked promising that it would clear for us, although I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would in time for our final ascent.</p>

<p>We had a good view across a small gully where the path was as obvious as could be. After a short descent down to a wee stream, the path was lost to us. A few phantom paths appeared, and we followed them, probably veering more towards the west than necessary, but we found a way. I kept my eye on SOTAGoat, to be sure I wasn‚Äôt being led astray, and we soon found ourselves both within the activation zone and the cloud. The trig appeared out of the mist, and we had made it!</p>

<p>Having eaten breakfast in Aberdeen at 5 a.m., it now felt like lunchtime, even though it was only around 09:15. At this point, I found out one of Fraser‚Äôs secrets to successful mountaineering ‚Äî <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttery_(bread)">butteries</a>. Claiming ‚Äúthis was all he could find in the cupboard,‚Äù he proceeded to eat what I‚Äôd estimate to be around 8,000 calories in a matter of minutes. Checking the schedule, we decided we had around 45 minutes on the summit before we should head back down.</p>
<p>Fraser had brought the FT-857 and his <a href="https://www.iz2uuf.net/wp/index.php/2013/04/06/100g-yagi/">100g yagi</a>, and was hopeful to activate on 2m. I was on HF with the KX2 and the 18ft (5.5m) random wire vertical. We each found a suitable pile of rocks to shelter behind and set to work.</p>

<p>I started on 40m; the antenna needs a transformer to get a match, and even though it‚Äôs short, I‚Äôve made contacts this way before. I thought I‚Äôd try 40m, as maybe it‚Äôs a desirable trig point or WAB etc., place that folks would want. I could hear some contest callers, but after my spot and calling with no replies, it was clearly completely dead for me, so I moved to 20m. After spotting and calling CQ, a slow trickle of replies came, and I relaxed once I crossed number 4! The replies kept coming, including four summit-to-summit stations in Germany, Switzerland, and Romania. I considered some other bands, but time was marching on, my hands were cold, and everything was getting wet. The sun suddenly shone through for a few moments, and it looked lovely. Two runners then came by, having climbed from the opposite side. They asked what I was doing, to which my usual answer is ‚Äúamateur radio, speaking to other people on mountains.‚Äù They were impressed with Switzerland and asked if I could say hi from them. They soon ran off again, and given they were in running shorts and vests, I‚Äôm not surprised they didn‚Äôt want to hang around.</p>

<p>I could hear Fraser still calling and trying to keep his wind vane under control. I got the thumbs up that he didn‚Äôt need to get on HF, so I packed up. We had a brief celebration‚Äîthis was my first 10-pointer‚Äîand then turned around and headed back down.</p>

<p>Once we were down out of the cloud, the view improved significantly! The cloud had started to lift, and we could see the surrounding summits and valleys‚Äîspectacular! Similar to the way up, paths came and went, but we had a clear view of the Dee and knew where to go.</p>

<p>Back on the bikes and back towards civilisation. We had a quick stop at the Chest of Dee waterfalls, where the pool looked lovely and inviting, before the final 5km or so to the car park. Up, activated, and back in under 6 hours.</p>

  <title>More QSL cards</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/more-qsl-cards/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A formal looking letter arrived for me this morning, when I looked closely I could see it was from Germany. Inside were some nice QSL cards.</p>
<p><a href="dk1mi.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/more-qsl-cards/dk1mi.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://dk1mi.radio/about/">Micheal</a> has two of his own from our HF SSB, HF FT8 and QO-100 QSOs over the past year, plus then the special one, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/DF0MF">DF0MF</a>, from the lightship in Emden. <a href="https://dk1mi.radio/amrumbank/">Micheal describes</a> his discovery and subsequent visit and activation of this historical ship.</p>
<p>I shall need to QSL, although Micheal‚Äôs two different cards makes me think about making a new QSL card for my portable SOTA operations. ‚õ∞Ô∏è</p>
<p>The TH-79E in the background of the photo also arrived today. The battery is dead and I have no power supply for it, and it was sold as ‚Äúseen‚Äù so let‚Äôs hope a new battery will fix it!</p>

  <title>Xiegu G90 WSJT-X Setup</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/g90-wsjtx-setup/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Last weekend when playing with the <a href="../../../posts/2024/something-for-the-weekend/">new antenna</a>, I ended up using my G90 for running FT8. However, it had been a long time since I‚Äôd used it for this and I‚Äôd forgotten what to do, even of which cable to plug in where! I also ran into a few issues, so this post is a reminder for myself of what to do.</p>
<section id="hardware" class="level2">

<figcaption>Cabling required</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I‚Äôm using the CAT cable that comes with the radio (with the blue USB), this plugs into the side of the head unit, with the person image (under the headphones). For audio I use a USB soundcard dongle (random off Amazon), and a headphones/mic splitter, and then a 8 pin mini DIN to TRRS audio cable. Think I bought this off ebay, like this <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/176417679066">one</a>. The alternative is buying the CE-19 expansion port‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs more expensive. This cable plugs into the DIN port on the back and then the USB into the computer.</p>
<p>On the G90 (I have firmware 1.78 so no U-D data mode), put the audio to line in with Fn+Power button, turn off compressor, turn off Preamo, and push the volume knob so it switches to headphones (unless you like listening to data modes!). There are some other recommended settings <a href="https://www.digitalshack.org/xiegu-g90-ft8/">from the internet</a> in the menu. Not sure how important they really are but I set them anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RF gain 50%</p></li>
<li><p>Mic Gain to 10</p></li>
<li><p>AUX In volume to 8</p></li>
<li><p>AUX out volume to 15</p></li>
</ul>

<p>WSJT-X has Xiegu G90 in the Radio menu but it‚Äôs very temperamental‚Ä¶at least for me. I found using <a href="http://www.w1hkj.com/">FLRig</a> as an intermediate for CAT control to be much better. You could just use VOX and skip CAT control. I also found newer version of FLRig had issues and went back to <a href="http://www.w1hkj.com/files/archives/Windows/flrig-1.4.8_setup.exe">v1.4.8</a> for a more stable experience.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>I adjust the sound in Windows Sound Settings so that the receive on the left is about 70 dB, and then adjust the slider in WSJT-X for the transmit power such that ALC is 99-100 on the G90. This should correspond to the power output set.</p>
<p>Then enjoy your digital operations! Probably works for all digital modes with other software too.</p>

<p>Took two of the kids with me on this one. They were keen for an adventure! Even packed their own bags with toys and random things, including ice cream and tea sets for a picnic on the summit. We parked in Donview forest car park and followed the red route up. Quite a steep bit near the start with wooden steps that the kids started counting, but then eased off and a more gentle climb after that. Nice and sheltered in the trees for much of the way. When we did get near the summit the wind was blowing an absolute gale - which everyone found amusing. We hunkered down behind a rock and the kids has their snack and picnic and I tried 2m FM. Managed three and then was worried I wouldn‚Äôt get my fourth. Heard MM0EFI calling but he couldn‚Äôt hear me, so I walked over the summit to the west side, just holding the pole with the slim G waving as the wind was blowing and then managed the QSO and even one more after that. Glad I didn‚Äôt have to get out HF as I think the kids had had enough of me messing about. Plus we had to be back in time for swim training.</p>

<p>The walk down was much easier, the little one started getting tired half way down but kept soldering on. We went into Kemney in search of a cafe for lunch but they were all closed except one. That one was mobbed and looked too fancy for us, so we had a picnic in the car from the Co-op!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Ever since I‚Äôve been on HF, I had the same EFHW in the back garden as my antenna. It‚Äôs been great, lots of contacts made all over the world on SSB and digital modes. Pretty much worldwide with FT8/4 but also good DX on SSB into South Africa, Japan, Brazil amongst others. Plus of course nice chats in UK/EU predominately across 40m and 20m. If the conditions are right, then pretty much any bit of wire in the air will work! However, I‚Äôve been looking to try something else, particularly a vertical and see how that works. I‚Äôve spoken to Mike, M0AWS, several times about different antenna and he recommended the <a href="https://m0aws.co.uk/?p=1998">vertical that he uses</a>. It‚Äôs a multiband antenna from 80-10m and, as you can see from his article, he‚Äôs made many contacts with it around the world. It seemed like something that I could put up in the garden on a temporary basis and give it a go‚Ä¶so with my ordered delivered and wire measured I was ready to go!</p>

</div>
<p>The antenna is fairly simple, and relies on a remote ATU to match the wire to the band of interest. I managed to pick up a CG-3000 from ebay recently, but there are many brands and options available, you can even use a manual tuner at the base - obviously less convenient. I‚Äôve seen the CG-3000 go for as little as ¬£75, although they‚Äôre typically around ¬£150. The radiating element is a 13.4m long piece of wire, attached to the CG-3000, up the side of the mast and then around 1m of it is tucked inside the mast. On the ground connector of the CG-3000 I connected an earth rod, suitable beaten into the ground around 60cm, and then four ~12m long radials laid on the ground at 90¬∞ to each other. The CG-3000 has a SO-239 connector for coax and a 4 pin connector for the power and control cable. Mine came with 5m of control cable, so that was my limiting factor in this setup. The controller on my unit was missing the power cable, it seemed to have been cut off only leaving two tiny ends of wire. I wanted to hook it into my Anderson powerpole junction box but turned out I had no red and black cables, and the replacement connector I found had the terminals the wrong way around. So I present the most error trap prone design for powering the CG-3000. My controller is an older model and says ‚ÄúTune‚Äù next to the button at the top, but really that‚Äôs reset - which is what it says on later models.</p>

<p>As I knew this was a temporary setup I didn‚Äôt do anything too special with the mounting, I made use of a piece of 68mm diameter drain pipe, a kids toy structure, some straps and a piece of wood with a hole drilled for the pole and some for ground pegs. DJ0IP has lots of <a href="https://www.dj0ip.de/spiderbeam/fiberglass-spiderpole/">good information</a> on using a spiderbeam pole, including mounting options. I found the wooden base was needed to keep it from tilting over, and luckily I had a holesaw of the right size. Although with the rubber cap on the bottom, it‚Äôs a tight fit and repeated taking in and out could rub the rubber away, so I might enlarge the hole a little. With the drain pipe mounted and the pole inside it was just a case of pulling up each section and tightening them. I think for long term installation, putting hose clamps at the base of each section, just above the section below, helps stop it collapsing. There‚Äôs lots of info online about this.</p>

</div>
<p>I did install a ground post next to the tuner, but in retrospect, for a temporary setup, I think this wasn‚Äôt necessary‚Ä¶mostly as it was a pain to get back out again, which I‚Äôll come to later. I laid the radials out on the ground, trying to get them to cover the most space. The advantage of setting up in the middle of the garden is being able to lay them out in all directions. Any permanent home I find for it will likely be along one side of the garden, so the radials will have to just go where they can.</p>

</div>
<p>My shack isn‚Äôt convenient for this setup, particularly with only 5m of control cable - although I suppose there‚Äôs no need for the control to be next to the radio - so I just setup in the kitchen and ran the cables out the door. This temporary setup just used a big LiFePO4 battery for radio and ATU, and that lasted the whole time. For my testing I wanted to use FT4/8, so I hooked up the G90 to my laptop. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve used the G90 with WSJTX, and that ended up taking me a while to sort out. I wanted to use the IC-705 as it‚Äôs so easy to use with a computer, however, this doesn‚Äôt work with the ATU. The CG3000 will automatically match the frequency when it receives rf of about 3-5W. The IC-705 has a protection system that will immediately reduce the output power to 1W when it detects a high SWR, this means it won‚Äôt trigger the tuning. I‚Äôve seen people online use a manual tuner in between the 705 and ATU to prevent the 705 dropping the power and getting it to tune, they then bypass the manual one. Of course the <a href="https://icomuk.co.uk/AH-705-HF-50-MHz-automatic-antenna-tuner/4051/1359/41/">AH-705</a> would be ideal for this situation and work effortlessly, perhaps perfect for portable/mobile setups. After some faffing things were fine. I could always put the radio into AM and hit the PTT and I could hear the relays working and watch the SWR drop.</p>
<p>It tuned every band from 80m to 10m, most were virtually 1.0 except 30m and 17m which were nearly 2, not sure why that was but they still worked fine and I made many contacts on 30m. I put out a test CQ on 20m to see what was what and the first pskreporter view was pleasing. I should‚Äôve saved the pskreporter view after my first 24 hours operation but I forgot.</p>

<p>By the time I had it all sorted out on the first day, it was pretty late at night, so I had a look on 80m, 60m, and 40m. Lots of activity on 60m which I‚Äôve never really been on, so that was fun, and I spent most of the evening there. The next day I tried as many bands as I could. Conditions weren‚Äôt the greatest but I still managed some nice contacts with a few new DX locations. I did notice I could hear all around the world, and many places I‚Äôd never heard before, so that was fun too. The most exciting from a DX perspective was 15m, particularly early evening, there seemed to be several openings both east and west. They‚Äôd come and go, but around long enough to make a QSO.</p>

<p>Highlights included California, Uruguay, Kyrgyzstan, Svalbard, Japan and Australia. I had potential to get some South Asia, pskreporter showed I was heard there, but never managed to get a QSO. These were all with 20W FT8 from the G90.</p>

<p>All in all, 30 countries, three or four new DX, and furthest contact was with VK3JLM, at 16,864 km. Pretty good I think!</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon, it was time to pack it away, and this is when I realised the ground rod might not have been such a good idea. A rod hammered over 0.5m into the ground doesn‚Äôt tend to want to come out that easily. Several places online suggested a jack to lift it out, I don‚Äôt have one of those, and someone suggested a drill and watering the ground. So that‚Äôs what I did. You have to be careful as the drill wants to turn and the rod doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶but once it‚Äôs loosened off, then drilling and pulling up brings it out.</p>

<p>Now all that‚Äôs left is to figure out how to set it up more permanently. Ideally it needs to go away from the house, but then it needs a lot of cabling running around the garden. There‚Äôs also the fact that it‚Äôs not the most attractive thing in the garden, even I admit that, and the best place is probably in full view of the kitchen and lounge. I‚Äôve read about people painting them grey/blue to soften their impact on the surroundings. I‚Äôll have to think about it. Probably for now, it‚Äôll be temporary setups, and hopefully I‚Äôll get slicker at that so I can pop it up for the day/evening and then take it down in the morning and not get in anyone‚Äôs way. MM0OPX has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl7830vNGjo">nice video</a> on quickly setting up a spiderbeam.</p>

</div>
<p>In the land of Aberdeenshire, in the rolling hills and verdant fields, there lies a summit of ancient repute: the Hill of Garvock. High above the plains it stands, crowned with a tower of stone that pierces the sky like the dark spire of Barad-d√ªr itself. And though it is not the Eye of Sauron that watches from its heights, it is nonetheless guarded‚Äîby a herd of formidable beasts, more docile in appearance but no less territorial than the fell orcs of Mordor. These were not the servants of some dark lord, but of a farmer, who tended his cows with the same care one might afford to a legion of fearsome trolls.</p>

<figcaption>A warning left by a previous traveler</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Yet, it was to this very summit that our company was bound, for in the air lay a quest most urgent: the activation of the Hill of Garvock, a task that would call forth the wizard‚Äôs skill in communicating across the very ether, from the highest point in the land.</p>
<p>I, the wizard of our company, bore the mantle of Gandalf, though my power lay not in staff nor sword but in the ancient art of invisible communication. Deep within my pack lay a Kenwood D72, my 6m staff of carbon fiber, and the slim G that would beacon out into the surrounds. The winds would carry my signals to those far off in Aberdeen, and to those kindred spirits who also sought the heights to send their voices across the void. At my side marched four brave souls, each chosen for this journey by the fates, and not being legally allowed to be left at home alone.</p>
<p>There was Legolas, my eldest daughter, whose eyes were sharp and whose feet were swift. She would scout ahead, her keen senses attuned to the slightest disturbance in the fields. Princess Galadriel, my youngest daughter, whose beauty was only matched by her inability to carry anything, walked beside me, her grace a light in the darkening day. And then there were the two hobbits twins, whose hearts were as large as their stature was small, and whose constant complaining, kept the chill of the sea wind at bay.</p>
<p>We set forth from the edge of the Laurencekirk Viewpoint, the last outpost of civilisation before the untamed fields. The sky was overcast, and the air held the promise of rain, yet we were undeterred. Alas, we were also ill-prepared, with only half party bringing their cloaks. The path ahead led us across open land, where no tree or boulder might shield us from the vigilant eyes of the bovine sentinels.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>The cows, vast in number and broad of horn, gazed upon us with suspicion as we approached their domain. Legolas, ever watchful, whispered of their movements. ‚ÄúThey are gathering, Father,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúforming a line as if to bar our passage.‚Äù I nodded, drawing my cloak about me as though it might ward off the cows‚Äô ponderous gaze.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFear not, my children,‚Äù I said, raising my carbon-6 mast. ‚ÄúWe have journeyed through lands more perilous than these (Edinburgh Airport customs border). Though the path is fraught with unseen dangers, we must press on.‚Äù</p>
<p>And so we did, our footsteps light but purposefully avoiding cow pats, as we crossed the meadow. The hobbits skipped merrily, laughing as they narrowly avoided an enormous pat, recently produced. Princess Galadriel‚Äôs voice, soft as a whispering brook, soothed the beasts as we passed, her words lost to the wind but not to the cows, who turned away as though under some enchantment.</p>

<figcaption>The tower and its guard</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At last, we reached the final field before the tower, the summit of Garvock now within our grasp. The stone structure loomed above us, a sentinel of old, marking the land for miles around. As we stepped into the activation zone, the winds howled, and the clouds parted, allowing the briefest shaft of sunlight to illuminate our path.</p>
<p>I raised my staff and sent out the call. The air shimmered with VHF magic, and our presence was made known across the land. The summit was activated, our voices carried far and wide, across hill and valley, to others who awaited our signal.</p>

</div>
<p>We awoke a wizard of exceptional experience, housed in our home town of Aberdeen, who‚Äôs voice had not been heard on 2m FM for over 20 years, but whose relentless questioning and detailed itemisation of his wizarding horde kept us within the range of the cows for longer than anyone was content with.</p>
<p>The quest was complete, and though the way back was still guarded by those bovine watchers, we knew the day was ours. With spirits high and laughter on our lips, we descended from the Hill of Garvock, in search of a cafe in Johnshaven and with the memory of our adventure etched forever in our hearts.</p>

  <title>Finally Making a LEO QSO</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After what feels <a href="../../../posts/2023/first-attempts-at-leo/">like ages</a> since I last ventured into the garden with my Yagi antenna and HT to attempt a contact via an FM satellite, I finally succeeded.</p>
<p>Last time I struggled with holding all the things, trying to find the satellite and using the radio. I only managed to hear for a short period and that was it. So I decided to make a phone holder which goes on the antenna. I‚Äôve seen several people do this on YouTube, and there are lots of designs already made online. I printed this <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/69675-arrow-antenna-tripod-and-cellphone-mount">one</a>, and bought a phone holder from Amazon that screws in.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>In practice it wasn‚Äôt quite as perfect as I thought it would be. It‚Äôs probably a few factors, not being perfectly aligned, maybe the metal in the antenna messes with the phone‚Äôs compass and perhaps other things but I had to hunt around a little for the satellite. Together with deciding at what orientation I should hold the antenna, and if it‚Äôs about time I change the frequency due to doppler, still left me feeling like I wasn‚Äôt going to have a chance.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="d72.jpeg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2" title="Radio and voice recorder"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/finally-making-a-leo-qso/d72.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Radio and voice recorder"></a></p>
<figcaption>Radio and voice recorder</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I did simplify the radio and audio end. Last time I had a series of cables from the radio splitting the audio into the voice recorder and into ear phones. This was either directly connected to the radio or via the mini-fist mic which has the three buttons on. I thought those buttons might be useful for swithcing VFO and adjusting the memories which have the doppler corrections pre-programmed.</p>
<p>This time I put the voice recorder in my shirt top pocket, and held the HT and used it directly. No audio cables. This cleared out the clutter and meant I had one hand on the yagi and one on the radio.</p>
<p>One Sunday evening in July I decided to go out and try it. I‚Äôd seen SO-50 was coming up and had a reasonable pass of around 10-15 minutes and at a good elevation. It was coming up over the neighbour‚Äôs house and then I would see it. I found it pretty quick and heard <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/M5JFS">M5JFS</a> calling CQ. I replied but he made a QSO with someone else, however, he then ended with ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a GM5 station calling‚Äù. Here was my chance, and I made the contact!</p>
<figure class="figure">
<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>However, in the excitement I lost the satellite and only heard the very beginning of John talking about it being my first satellite contact. I did find the satellite again and people had moved on. I didn‚Äôt manage to make another contact on that pass.</p>
<p>Hearing John and myself on the audio made me ‚Äúsee‚Äù how slick an experienced satellite operator is and how much thinking I was doing just to say what I did üòÖ.</p>
<p>The D72 is a full duplex radio, however, I didn‚Äôt hear myself on the downlink. Now perhaps I didn‚Äôt have some setting right (although I checked it several times), but when I emailed John afterwards and mentioned it, he suggested that I wasn‚Äôt hearing myself when I tx‚Äôd because the sat downlink is weakish relative to my uplink power and it was a fairly low pass. So even with filtering in the radio, there might still have been some de-sense going on sufficient to knock out my downlink.</p>
<p>I have since made one more contact, also on SO-50, also not doing that great at keeping the satellite in my yagi‚Äôs path. I‚Äôve heard people talk about printing out the sat‚Äôs path, and then working out landmarks around my house and what bearing they are, to then try and follow the path without the AR phone app.</p>

<p>What I am thinking of doing, is building a rotator for the yagi, and having the computer control the tracking. I think it would be a fun project. I‚Äôve started buying some of the pieces for this <a href="https://www.sarcnet.org/rotator-mk1.html">simple rotator</a> by the Australian SARCnet. It‚Äôs not a permanent setup but more of a sunny afternoon in the garden arrangement.</p>
<p>However, at the moment, because of the sunny afternoons, and the school holidays, I haven‚Äôt had time to make it, and any free time I have had, I‚Äôve gone out to a SOTA summit instead! So it may take another 6 months before I build it and try for a satellite QSO again. Maybe next time I‚Äôll try a SSB one!</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had my eye on this summit for a while. It‚Äôs 8 points for starters, and I‚Äôve been doing a lot of 1 pointers recently, but it‚Äôs quite the drive to get to, so whilst it doesn‚Äôt take long to climb, the total round trip is considerable. It‚Äôs also (just) over 1,000m high but the car park is at 670m, so the actual ascent is only 420m - very similar to some lower summits. Morven, a 4 point summit, was a 650m ascent!</p>
<p>The weather was sunny in Aberdeen when I left, and the forecast threaten rain later in the afternoon. I did my calculations and figured I‚Äôd be back in the car before the rain came. It‚Äôs only a 45-60 minute ascent.</p>
<p>You start in the upper car park at Glenshee ski centre, you can park right by the start of the track. The car park is ¬£4 which you pay for via a website, except in the valley there‚Äôs no 4G+, so you need to wait until you‚Äôre up the first slope and get signal again before you can pay. The alternative is stop in at the cafe and pay, but I‚Äôd already parked and wanted to get going.</p>

<p>The route is fairly straight forward in summer. The path is obvious, although it had a lot of loose gravel in many places. There are a few ups and downs along the way but nothing too bad. The steepest part is beyond the ski lift buildings on the final rise up to the main plateau. The path looks obvious from a distance but when you‚Äôre on it, it blends in with the terrain. Again, lots of loose stones here but a steady pace and I was at the top.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs still another 600m or so until you get to the actual summit, and I could see it being very easy to get lost in low cloud at this point, especially on the way back, it‚Äôs wide and featureless. Luckily the cloud wasn‚Äôt low, it was overcast but the view was still amazing, and on a clear day it must be spectacular.</p>

<p>I met another walker sitting in the cairn having his lunch. We spoke for a bit and then I looked for somewhere else to setup. A bit further away there were two smaller piles of rocks I thought I could shelter behind. The wind was persistent and I needed my hood to keep my ears warm.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve taken to just activating summits with VHF if I can, not that I don‚Äôt like doing HF, I just enjoy the simplicity of using a handheld and speaking to the locals. This is particularly the case if I don‚Äôt want to be sitting around for a long time, and whilst the rain‚Äôs arrival was forecast to be later still, I didn‚Äôt really want to hang around more than necessary. I setup the slim G on the carbon-6 pole and started calling CQ.</p>

</div>
<p>I‚Äôd forgotten to spot, but I started on 145.500 MHz, the 2m calling frequency, and I‚Äôm used to 2m spotting not really helping. Stations started coming back to me from considerable distances, at least what I‚Äôm used to. Something I‚Äôm not used to is everyone asking to QSY to another frequency. The first caller who asked I sort of ignored his first request as I didn‚Äôt think it was necessary, but I did then move and we had a nice chat. I guess when there‚Äôs actually some activity or a big area it makes sense to move. I‚Äôve just used to the 4-6 people on 2m when I‚Äôm on the lower summits nearer Aberdeen that it doesn‚Äôt matter if we talk for 15 minutes on the calling frequency as there‚Äôs no-one else!</p>
<p>My furthest was 92 miles right across the west coast to GM4OAS. I was only a 31 for him but we managed. Had GM0USI/M driving on the A90 between Perth and Dundee, and then a guy walking his dog somewhere in East Lothian carrying his boafeng with him. He just had a rubber duck on, but his signal was strong with me, his audio was a bit muffled at times though. He gave his call as M7SGX, and so I was confused where he was, thinking he was in England. However, he‚Äôd just chosen to omit the RSL. Unless I misheard him several times!<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt get anyone back in Aberdeen but I had 8 which was plenty. I did spot myself and called some more but that was it. I heard someone else but I think it was a repeater and my VFO B happened to be on its frequency but I didn‚Äôt have it programmed in (assume it was the Dundee one). As it happens I don‚Äôt think any of the repeaters in my D72 are correct, and I should add the others around Scotland.</p>

<p>The excitement of such far reaching FM contacts had kept me distracted from other walkers who were around and the cold wind. I looked up to see a few other people walking around, but no-one came to talk to me. I finished my lunch, debated about HF for a moment, but then decided I‚Äôd rather be getting home and packed up.</p>
<p>The walk down was trickier due to the scree patches and at one point I started marching off in the wrong direction as the path split. I could see the car park so I quickly realised the path wasn‚Äôt taking me down to it.</p>
<p>Next time I think a yagi and a radio with 2m SSB!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It‚Äôs the summer holidays and so the kids are home all the time, or we‚Äôre away etc. and I didn‚Äôt think I would get to do very much SOTA during the holidays. However, today the younger ones were off on a play date with some friends, so that just left my eldest and I at home. Left to her own devices she would spend all her time <strong>on</strong> devices! So I figured we should go climb a hill!</p>
<p>My usual research method of browsing the <a href="https://sotl.as/map/">sotlas map</a> and asking the WhatsApp group led to Craiglich with the prospect of a tea room afterwards. The tea room was the real winner here. üç∞</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="route.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Path to the top"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-068/route.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Path to the top"></a></p>

<p>There‚Äôs a small car park on the north side of the road and after climbing a rickerty gate, we were off!</p>

<p>The path starts along through a field and then enters the forest. It‚Äôs a little wet and boggy at first, but nothing major. The pathway is quite narrow with heather and pines growing close by. I was wearing shorts and was beginning to regret that idea on the grounds of tick risk! Although I managed the whole walk without any incident.</p>

<figcaption>Through the forest</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There‚Äôs only one real turn that you have to look for in the forest, where you bear to the left to climb the hill. At this point it‚Äôs a little steeper but overall the path is gentle and very pleasant. You come out of the forest into the open area with nice purple heather covering the hillside. I‚Äôd recently bought <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sota-goat/id590206108">Sotagoat app</a>, so my daugther was using it to track the summit. It‚Äôs a convenient app for finding the summit and telling you when you‚Äôre in the activation area. It offers an offline database too, so you can find information without phone reception, and finally spotting is easy from it. Probably does more but I‚Äôve not looked into it too much yet.</p>
<p>We reached the top and I setup my slim G on the mast on the cairn, with the D72 and called CQ on 2m FM. I spoke to the locals, including Chris, MM7RVC, who‚Äôd literally just completed his intermediate exam and had passed. So we all congratulated him on that! I also spoke with Bruce, MM6BWS, who was a new local contact for me.</p>
<p><a href="craiglich-5.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-4"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-068/craiglich-5.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I did hear another station on a summit, and heard him having a QSO with MM7MOX (Andy), although I couldn‚Äôt hear Andy. Looking at MM7MOX‚Äôs activations and logs, he was on Torlum (GM/SS-227) at the time I think it must‚Äôve been Lee, MM7LEF/P, on Scald Law (GM/SS-125) that I could hear. He was working 2m FM at exactly the time I could hear him as it was interrupting my chat with Bruce. Pretty amazing as it‚Äôs almost 150 km away and there are big hills between us. Aircraft scatter? I don‚Äôt know, I should email him!</p>

<figcaption>That is quite the distance!</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I got my four and this trip was not about contacts, so we packed and headed down the hill in preparation for the best part of the trip!</p>
<p>We were going to go to Tarland tea room but when I looked at the map I saw there was one in Lumphanan and that was on our route home, so seemed a better choice. Alas! it proved no good as they only took cash and I had none. The nearest cash machine was miles away and, being a Sunday, the local post office was shut. That was a shame as it looked a lovely little tea room. So we continued on into Banchory and found somewhere there. The Birdhouse cafe. It was fine - a bit too hipster coffee house for me but I had a cup of tea and my daugther a can of diet coke.</p>
<p>Our other task was to find some jam sugar after our strawberry picking, and it seems the only store in Aberdeenshire that had any was the Morrisons in Banchory - whilst it was the last shop we visited it wasn‚Äôt the first!</p>

<p>Maybe we‚Äôll manage another in the holidays‚Ä¶and I‚Äôll have to be better prepared on the tea shop side!</p>

  <title>Setting up Heltec V3 868MHz on TinyGS</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/setting-up-heltec-v3-868mhz-on-tinygs/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://tinygs.com/">TinyGS</a>, is a network system to retrieve LoRa satellite data using ESP devices, much like SatNOGS. Everything is managed via the <a href="https://github.com/G4lile0/tinyGS">GitHub</a> repo and the <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/DmYSElZahiJGwHX6jCzB3Q">Telegram channels</a>.</p>
<p>Getting started and flashing the software on devices is very easy via their <a href="https://installer.tinygs.com/">web installer</a>. You then request a username and password via their Telegram bot. I‚Äôm not detailing much as their instructions are plain and the process is super easy. You do have to use Telegram but it‚Äôs okay.</p>
<p>They have a list of <a href="https://github.com/G4lile0/tinyGS?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware">supported hardware</a>, and whilst the V3 isn‚Äôt mentioned, people on Telegram says it works. Plus when I flashed mine, it came up in the dropdown to choose it. However, it only showed the 433 MHz version.</p>
<p>Telegram is fine and that, but like Discord, it‚Äôs not the easiest to find useful information. Compared to Discourses forum or Github issues etc., however, it does cost the project team nothing so I don‚Äôt begrudge them that. You can search posts but it takes a lot of effort to work through them and likely multiple conversations happening at the same time. Hence this post‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You can change the frequency by logging into the webadmin, which, strangely, is actually the public website and not the dashboard that runs locally on your device. You have to request a link from the TinyGS telegram bot with <code>/weblogin</code> and it produces a tinygs.com url for you. As it‚Äôs Telegram I‚Äôm using my phone for it, no doubt there‚Äôs a computer client too.</p>

<p>The top dropdown lets you change it to 868 (or 900+ depending on your region) MHz, and voila!</p>
<section id="but-dont-bother" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-dont-bother">But don‚Äôt bother</h2>
<p>Why? Because there are only four <a href="https://tinygs.com/satellites">supported satellites</a> and at ~900 MHz you‚Äôll need a decent antenna to pick up the data and I‚Äôm not sure the device can manage the doppler shift well enough to get anything meaningful. Just get a 433 MHz device and enjoy the experience. üõ∞Ô∏è</p>

  <title>SOTA API and Google AI to find the Goat</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After my double activation yesterday (which I‚Äôve yet to write up), I bumped into Fraser, <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/MM0EFI">MM0EFI</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theradiorover/">RadioRover</a> YouTube fame, in Tesco. He was asking when I was going to be doing some higher point summits, as mostly I‚Äôve been doing ones near to the house which don‚Äôt score that high. There are quite a <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES">few in my region</a>. After browsing sotl.as some more, I was curious as to how long it took Fraser to reach Mountain Goat. This is the award you get when you reach 1,000 points.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="image.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="MM0EFI‚Äôs stats"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2024/sota-api-and-google-ai-to-find-the-goat/image.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="MM0EFI‚Äôs stats"></a></p>

</div>
<p>You can see his <a href="https://sotl.as/activators/MM0EFI">activation list on sotl.as</a>, and it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs done a lot of summits and a lot of high pointers. However, the question still remained‚Ä¶how long did it take?</p>
<p>I know the SOTA database has an API, as several other sites use it and I‚Äôve seen it mentioned in the reflector, but I hadn‚Äôt come across any documentation. Searching around I find <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/request-for-information-about-db-and-api/28752/4">this post</a> which gets me started. I work out MM is associationID 03, and then querying <a href="https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_roll?associationID=03"><code>https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_roll?associationID=03</code></a>, I can look up Fraser‚Äôs UserID.</p>
<p>In the past I‚Äôve used python to query APIs, put the JSON into a pandas dataframe then calculate and plot things from there. A quick way to get going with this is in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colaboratory</a>. It‚Äôs a free jupyter notebook in which many python packages are already installed and it‚Äôs quick to jump in and get going. Unsurprisingly, it now features a LLM AI assistant, where you can just type in what you want and it generates several options of code for you to run and see what happens.</p>
<p>My first prompt (including spelling mistakes but now corrected) was:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>retreive JSON from api url: https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_log_by_id?year=all&amp;id and create a plot of ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Option #2 of Gemini spat out some commented code, I tweaked the date column name, as it just guessed it was called <code>Date</code> not <code>ActivatorDate</code>, and tah-dah ‚ú®</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After <a href="../../../sota/2024/gm-es-070/">Hill of Fare</a>, I drove across to Benaquhallie, and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/a8nNR6BCH9RMpJiQ7">parked</a> by the side of an old farm building. There‚Äôs not really much space to park, and I think the house is still occupied so you can‚Äôt block the road, but maybe two cars could park there.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="route.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Park at the red dot and follow the path"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-065/route.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Park at the red dot and follow the path"></a></p>
<figcaption>Park at the red dot and follow the path</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The route up is fairly easy going, you walk east in front and around the summit before turning back on yourself and climbing up to the top. There‚Äôs a trig point where the summit marker is but then down the hill a little, along that path, is the cairn.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>I started with 2m at the trig point and managed 3, and then another 3 on 70cm. Meanwhile Chris, MM7RVP, was up Cairn-mon-earn and calling CQ on 2m as well. The four of us could hear him but he seemed to struggle to recieve. Like <a href="../../../sota/2024/gm-es-080/">I did</a>, there‚Äôs quite a bit of QRM from the communications towers there and I think his handheld was getting overloaded.</p>

<figcaption>Slim G by the cairn</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I setup the Slim G to see if that would help get through the Chris, but no luck again. So I took it down and setup HF. I did manage to get Chris on both 40m and 20m, for our summit to summit. I then called on 20m and ended up with another 11 EU contacts, including a summit to summit in Switzerland.</p>

<p>I was pleased to manage two summits in one day. I had to be back for school pickup so timing wise it worked out quite well. There was a 1:20 gap between my last contact on Hill of Fare and my first on Benaquhallie, so these pair are a good combo, espeically if you can activate on VHF/UHF!</p>
<p>Mike, 2M0WMA, also taught us all, over the air, how to pronounce Benaquhallie. It‚Äôs something like ‚Äúben-a-whallie‚Äù, but with some good accent on the Wh. I think I was the only whallie that day.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Another nice day and another chance for some activiations. After my trip to <a href="../../../sota/2024/gm-es-075/">Strathfinella</a> and not doing Garvock on the same day, I was determined to try for two in one day today. So I was more prepared with lunch and routes this time.</p>
<p>First was Hill of Fare. There‚Äôs a car park called <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ERdUMuy4Y7aU9nzL8">Back of Hill of Fare</a> on the B993 where there‚Äôs space for 5-10 cars by the side of a log store. I then followed the path up from there. A couple of new looking fences have been installed but there are some nice gates. They had very high handles, which I thought was strange, but then someone pointed out they‚Äôre for horse riders.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Good views on the way up</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Probably took around 50-60 minutes to reach the top. It‚Äôs quite a wide opening at the top, with some small pools of water.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt want to hang about long, so 2M FM got me 3 contacts and then I switched to 70cm to activate the summit. Three people, 4 callsigns and 2 bands in about 10 minutes! Time to go to the next one, and hopefully arrive in time to catch Chris, MM7RVP, going up Cairn-mon-earn for a summit to summit contact.</p>

  <title>Strathfinella Hill</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-075/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Another <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-075">hill</a>, this time to the south of Aberdeen. The weather was wet and windy in the morning, particularly so inland, so thought I‚Äôd stick to the coast. The two options were Strathfinella or <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-085">Hill of Garvock</a>. Reports of angry cows from Garvock, plus the sheltered nature of the wooded summit of Strathfinella made the decision for me.</p>
<p>Consulting Fraser, <a href="https://youtube.com/@theradiorover">MM0EFI</a>, the local SOTA expert, I was going to climb it from the south, following forestry roads and mountain bike paths. Looked to be fairly short route and a quick claim to the top. It‚Äôs only a one pointer, so never going to be that far.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="map.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Route from the south"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-075/map.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Route from the south"></a></p>
<figcaption>Route from the south</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The weather was pretty good, breezy but some sun and mild. The route was straightforward- literally. There were a few bikers around who I met just before the turn off to the summit.</p>

<p>I had a chat with some of the mountain bikers but just said I was out for a walk. Too much effort to get into the real reason! They pointed me towards the trig point which was off to the side of the main path. I almost missed it whilst walking along! It‚Äôs right in the trees, and reminded me of the portal stones from the Realm of the Enderlings book series!</p>
<p>I set up 2m first and got a guy down in Brechin, unfortunately he was the only 2m QSO. I spent a long time calling and then decided to move to HF.</p>
<p>The summit is a bit of a black spot for mobile reception and I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that. I use my phone for 2m spotting and for SOTA spotting or looking up other activators. I‚Äôve signed up and registered for APRS to SOTA, and SOTAMAT, a FT8 spotter, and maybe even a SMS one, but do I know how to use them?! üòÖ</p>
<p>I eventually managed to spot myself on 40m and got a few contacts. 20m spot did work but no one ever came back to me‚Ä¶even though I‚Äôd had a few contacts with other callers.</p>

</div>
<p>I managed two S2S contacts in Germany. One was an exchange of 11-31 each way but we managed to get my callsign and SOTA reference communicated.</p>
<p>On the way down I thought about doing Hill of Garvock but I hadn‚Äôt packed lunch and still had to get back home. Maybe a double activation next time!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A lovely sunny day, and time for another activation. Hopefully better than the last ‚Äì certainly the weather was better. üåû</p>
<p>Quite a close summit to home, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-086">Brimmond Hill</a> overlooks Aberdeen and the airport to the east and then Aberdeenshire to the west. There‚Äôs a walk up and over it which is popular with dog walkers, and so I met more people than I usually do on this summit. The hill also features several commercial towers which make a bit of noise on 2m. Usually a pip every so often and then a huge blast of rf that completely wipes anything out, interestingly around the 2m and 70cm calling frequencies but not so bad away from them.</p>

<p>I tried 2m first, with the Slim G on the pole and made a couple of contacts locally. There‚Äôs a bench that looks out over Aberdeen that I was going to setup on, but the aforementioned dog walkers came by and sat on the bench, so I decided to move off and find a spot in the heather. MM7RVC recorded me calling at his house somewhere to the west, showing off his pole and slim G ‚Äì so we got a SG2SG QSO.</p>

<p>For HF I went with the EFHW for 40m, with the 49:1 (keep meaning to write up making that but not got round to it yet! Nothing special mind), setup on the 6m carbon pole. Generally running north-south. The weather was lovely, there was a breeze but it wasn‚Äôt too cold, and so for most of the time I tried chasing other summit activators. This worked well, as I ended up with five summit-to-summit (S2S) QSOs across England, German, Austria and Poland. I then put out spots for myself and got a few more contacts.</p>
<p>I think the battery was low in the radio as it was only outputting 5W, not that 10W would‚Äôve made a huge difference, but I still find it impressive what 5W can do.</p>

<p>It was time to pack up, and I thought I‚Äôd see if I could catch anyone else on VHF/UHF. There‚Äôs a local lunchtime net, although I can never remember if its 12:30, 1 or 1:30pm that it starts. I got my Slim G back out and on the mast and this time I did sit on the bench. The net was going on and after a long over I managed to break in and say hello. We also did a quick QSO on 70cm. I‚Äôm not sure if the Slim G is suitable for 70cm. It worked but at what SWR? I should measure it and see. Another couple with their dog came up and wanted to come to the view point but one look of me and they decided to keep going! üòÖ At this point my HT ran out of battery too!</p>

<p>Interesting to get a SWL (shortwave listener) card confirming they heard me make a contact with someone else. It was a QSL with PB37EUDXF, which I remember having a hard time copying as I wasn‚Äôt expecting their callsign to be so long!</p>

<p>Amateur radio is about the experimentation and education of radio, and politics and world affairs aren‚Äôt part of the hobby. I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt want the war as much as any other regular person. üßëü§ùüßë</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It‚Äôs been a few weeks since my last activation and I wanted to go out. I didn‚Äôt have much time as I was meant to be sorting out the garage, so I picked a summit close to home, Cairn-Mon-Earn (<a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-080">GM/ES-080</a>).</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>It‚Äôs quite an easy walk following the loggers roads up to the summit. There are multiple towers there for mobile phones and other networks. The local repeater, <a href="https://www.grampianrepeatergroup.co.uk/gb3gn">GB3GN</a>, is also here. The weather was dry, and I had the occasional blue sky, but showers were forecasted.</p>
<p>It was windy too, so I hunkered down by the cairn, however, this probably wasn‚Äôt the best place being so close to the towers. I setup my slim G 2m on the mast and called CQ. I didn‚Äôt get any response so setup on HF. The ground slopes away with heather and bushes, so I decided just to go for the random wire vertical. It has a 5.5m radiator and 2 counterpoises. I started on 20m, and two stations replied, Spain and Finland. This turned out to be my lot on HF. I tried other bands and calling other stations but no one could hear me. It was a shame as there were several other summits I could hear.</p>

<p>I managed to get MM0EFI on the HT, and so I was at 3 contacts. A SOTA summit needs 4 to activate. It had been about an hour and the rain started to come down heavily. I dashed across to some nearby trees and setup underneath one of them. After trying all the bands I came back to 20m, put out another spot and the same Spanish station came back to me‚Ä¶well at least I knew it wasn‚Äôt operator error with the radio or antenna!</p>

<p>This was meant to be a quick activation and I‚Äôd now been there for over and hour, and so decided to pack up HF. I could see the TV mast in the clouds and so walked over to get a better look. I then found what would be a great spot to activate (if it wasn‚Äôt raining) as it had clear views all around. I thought I might as well call on 2m and see if I could get anyone.</p>
<p>I spoke to Fraser again, MM0EFI, now /M as he was driving to work. We made a contact with his intermediate callsign, 2M0EFI/M, so technically I‚Äôd activated the site. However, I was determined to get four different people, and in my next CQ, George, MM0SAX/M, replied.</p>

<p>George was driving up from Glasgow on the A90 and has a radio in his work van. We had a nice chat for about 15 minutes, and that turned my ‚Äúthis has been a waste of time ü§¨‚Äù attitude into a ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt so bad üôÇ‚Äù one!</p>
<p>I enjoy HF and setting up different antenna, but if I could reliably activate with just 2m/70cm I‚Äôd love to go up the hillside with just my HT.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I was hungry for points, and wanted something a bit more challenging to try out, and whilst browsing <a href="https://sotl.as/map/">sotlas</a> and chatting with the Aberdeenshire SOTA WhatsApp group, Morven was decided.</p>

<p>I climbed from the east side, parking along the road just at a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wwGugdext5RNCAbA9">junction</a>. Space for maybe 5 cars here. You walk across the field and past an abandoned house. As you go through the gate you have to turn right immediately on a faint looking track otherwise you‚Äôll be off walking around the hill wondering why you aren‚Äôt going up. It‚Äôs not very obvious at all, but after a little while the track starts to appear again. I‚Äôd been warned!</p>

<p>The gradient steps up quite a bit and it‚Äôs a pretty relentless 300m climb. It starts to level out and you think you must be nearly there‚Ä¶but no you‚Äôre probably only about half way, but at least it‚Äôs nearly flat for a while. This process repeats and you think you‚Äôre nearly there again after climbing another steep section but no! Still a bit further to go.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day at the top and I tried 2m FM first. I just have the slightly longer whip on the Boafeng, it‚Äôs okay but not the best. Others seem to have the slim G antenna from <a href="http://www.spectrumcomms.co.uk/Aerials.htm">Spectrum communications</a>, so I might need to get one of those. Only ¬£20. I had 3 on 2m, and then tried the repeater and got one of the same people again!</p>

<p>I then setup HF, it was quite windy and the pole was getting blown about a lot but it was fine. I was trying out my newly made EFHW.

<p>A couple of folks started up the hill a bit after me, I was probably at the gate when they left the car park but I think the steepness slowed them down considerable as I was on my way back down before I met them.</p>
<p>Back down was easier although you had to be careful with loose stones on the path when it was quite steep. Driving home I did a big sneeze in the car and felt something strange in my abdomen, this later turned out to be an inguinal hernia. Eugh.</p>

<p>After my <a href="../../../sota/2024/gm-es-061/">first summit</a>, I was keen to go again. I didn‚Äôt get much opportunity for a few weeks but then one Friday I was off work and it was a glorious day so it seemed like the perfect opportunity. The route in <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-059">Sotlas</a> was the one I took. There‚Äôs a small car park at the start of the route near Knockburn Loch - a favourite place for paddle boarding and other lake activities. The start is a dirt road that the loggers and farmers use and so an easy walk gently uphill.</p>

<p>Once you start getting into the forest part you turn off the road and onto a track. The weather had been quite wet and there was evidence of run off washing away a lot of the path up. It was like walking on a dry river bed!</p>

<p>The gradient picks up in the forest area and then you emerge around 400m up looking up to the summit and across to the south, where there‚Äôs a wind farm on the side of the hill. The walk from here continues up and round to the summit. I had blue skies and a bit of haze in the distance but great views all round.</p>

<p>This time I had a much lighter pack with me. I‚Äôd been lucky in find a used KX2, and it is <em>considerably</em> lighter than my G90 plus huge battery! I have it tucked into a little LowePro camera case and I printed a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4973035">front cover</a> to protect it whilst in transit. I was using the short random wire vertical as before. This is a 5.5m radiator, with two 4.25m counterpoises. They‚Äôre attached via bananaplugs to a BNC, then a short piece of coax with a common mode choke into the radio. I also had my Boafeng for 2m FM.</p>

<p>I got 3 on 2m FM from Aberdeen and shire, then setup on HF. Where the G90 can tune the antenna on 40m, the KX2 can‚Äôt - not without a helper transformer. So I went straight to 20m, where I managed another 10 contacts. The highlight being <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/JW9DSA">JW9DSA</a> from Svalbard. I didn‚Äôt know where JW was at the time and he was a very strong signal, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. He did keep saying ‚Äúhello from the artic‚Äù, and thanking me for the SOTA activation. I sort of assumed it was Russian somewhere. When I got home I looked him up and saw where and what they were up to! He wasn‚Äôt on a summit at the time, just in the camp calling others. A good contact at around 1,500 miles, and makes the map look bigger!</p>

<p>I‚Äôd also tried out the <a href="posts/2024/building-a-tiny-mic/">tiny mic</a> for the first time. I assumed it worked okay as no-one said anything untowards. I also had the audio repeat (I forget the proper term), so I could hear myself and it seemed fine to me also. It was back down and back home. I was hot by the time I got back as the weather was warm and it was sunny. Had a nice cup of tea at home, looked at the logs and then it was time to pick the kids up from school!</p>

  <title>Building a tiny mic üéôÔ∏è</title>

<p>In an effort to slim down my travel kit, I decided that a tiny mic was in order. I‚Äôve seen several people on YouTube use small mics and I‚Äôve seen some for sale on eBay but when I found this <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/320559-mini-microphone-for-trusdx-usdx-kx2-and-kx3">design</a>, I knew I had to build one.</p>

<p>The site has a list of what you need and most of the components can be found on aliexpress for a very low price. You just have a wait a bit for delivery. You end up with 10 or more of each and my total was around ¬£5 delivered.</p>
<p>It is very small! First I connected it up with what I thought was thin hook up wire but it was too big and difficult when I tried to squeeze it into the case.</p>

<p>I used some of the sotabeams thin wire I‚Äôd made an antenna from and this was much better. I also placed each component inside the 3D print and measured out the wire more precisely. It was fiddly but meant there wasn‚Äôt too much extra wire to squeeze in.</p>

<p>The top half of the case clicks together but does need a fair amount of force to get it on. The nut for the 3.5mm socket holds that in place and we‚Äôre ready to go.</p>

<p>I might make one for the G90 next.</p>
