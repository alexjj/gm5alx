It's quite a long walk to An Socach, although enjoyable, particularly around Loch nan Eun. The side up An Socach is steep, and several reports mention this, particularly when done as the loop of 5 munros. Although skipping it doesn't make the route much shorter.

Once we were done, we headed down the ridge and back to our bikes. The cycle ride was mostly downhill and an easy end to the long day. Back home by 18:30, meant I was out of the house for 14 1/2 hours! What a great day!
