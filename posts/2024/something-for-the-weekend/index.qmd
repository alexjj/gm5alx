Ever since I've been on HF, I had the same EFHW in the back garden as my antenna. It's been great, lots of contacts made all over the world on SSB and digital modes. Pretty much worldwide with FT8/4 but also good DX on SSB into South Africa, Japan, Brazil amoungst others. Plus of course nice chats in UK/EU predominately across 40m and 20m. If the conditions are right, then pretty much any bit of wire in the air will work! However, I've been looking to try something else, particularly a vertical and see how that works. I've spoken to Mike, M0AWS, several times about different antenna and he recommended the [vertical that he uses](https://m0aws.co.uk/?p=1998). I's a multiband antenna from 80-10m and as you can see from his article, he's made many contacts with it around the world. It seemed like something that I could put up in the garden on a temporary basis and give it a go...so with my ordered delivered and wire measured I was ready to go!

![Schematic of setup](schematic.png)

The antenna is fairly simple, and relies on a remote ATU to match the wire to the band of interest. I managed to pick up a CG-3000 from ebay recently, but there are many brands and options available, you can even use a manual tuner at the base - just obviously less convenient. I've seen the CG-3000 go for as little as £75, although they're typically around £150. The radiating element is a 13.4m long piece of wire, attached to the CG-3000, up the side of the mast and then around 1m of it is tucked inside the mast. On the ground connector of the CG3000 I connected an earth rod, suitable beaten into the ground around 60cm, and then four ~12m long radials laid on the ground at 90° to each other. The CG-3000 has a SO-239 connector for coax and a 4 pin connector for the power and control cable. Mine came with 5m of control cable, so that was my limiting factor in this setup.

As I knew this was a temporary setup I didn't do anything too special with the mounting, I made use of a piece of 68mm diameter drain pipe, a kids toy structure, some straps and a piece of wood with a hole drilled for the pole and some for ground pegs. DJ0IP has lots of [good information](https://www.dj0ip.de/spiderbeam/fiberglass-spiderpole/) on using a spiderbeam pole, including mounting options. I found the wooden base was needed to keep it from tilting over, and luckily I had a holesaw of the right size.  Although with the rubber cap on the bottom, it's a tight fit and repeated taking in and out could rub the rubber away, so I might enlarge the hole a little. With the drain pipe mounted and the pole inside it was just a case of pulling up each section and tightening them. I think for long term installation, putting hose clamps at the base of each section, just above the section below, helps stop it collapsing. There's lots of info online about this.

I did install a ground post next to the tuner, but in retrospect, for a temporary setup, I think this wasn't necessary...mostly as it was a pain to get back out again, which I'll come to later. I laid the radials out on the ground, trying to get them to cover the most space. The advantage of setting up in the middle of the garden is being able to lay them out in all directions. Any permanent home I find for it will likely be along one side of the garden, so the radials will have to just go where they can.

My shack isn't convenient for this setup, particularly with only 5m of control cable - although I suppose there's no need for the control to be next to the radio - so I just setup in the kitchen and ran the cables out the door. This temporary setup just used a big LiFePO4 battery for radio and ATU, and that lasted the whole time. For my testing I wanted to use FT4/8, so I hooked up the G90 to my laptop. It's been a long time since I've used the G90 with WSJTX, and that ended up taking me a while to sort out. I wanted to use the IC-705 as it's so easy to use with a computer, however, this doesn't work with the ATU. The CG3000 will automatically match the frequency when it receives rf of about 3-5W. The IC-705 has a protection system that will immediately reduce the output power to 1W when it detects a high SWR, this means it won't trigger the tuning. I've seen people online use
