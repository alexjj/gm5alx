The second summit of the day. As the last day of the winter bonus it would've been good to do a 2+ pointer to get those extra three points, but I've done so many already that there aren't any left that I could do and still get back in time for school pick up. So I thought I'd tick this one off my list. I had been saving it to do with the kids but sometimes it's good to known the hill before you bring everyone with you!

It's a nice little hill in Ballater, and has many paths around and up it. I chose to take the shortest, but also steepest route up to the top. It is pretty steep!
