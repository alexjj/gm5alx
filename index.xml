  <title>Introducing wen goat üêê app</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>As you can tell from this blog, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota.html">SOTA summits</a>. The big award is at 1,000 points, when you can proudly claim to be a Mountain Goat. Since I started being more serious about this late last year, I‚Äôve been looking at how long it will take me to achieve MG. My friend Tim, G5OLD, has also been looking at the same thing - although he‚Äôs much closer than I am! It seemed to me like a wee webapp was needed for this and thus ‚Äú<a href="https://wengoat.streamlit.app/">wen goat</a>‚Äù was born!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a python app and hosted on streamlit.io, as that makes everything very easy. Ideally, I‚Äôd integrate it into this blog but maybe another time. You enter your callsign and then it looks up your activation data (assuming you‚Äôre a SOTA activator and have an account and logged your activations) and then it plots these plus a few trends forwards towards the 1,000 point mark.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs gone through a few iterations, including contributions by <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/OE5JFE">OE5JFE</a>, which was very kind of Joe. It shows you your historical performance, and gives you the option to enter your own expected future performance. Further down the page it allows you to set a target date when you want to achieve MG by, and then it‚Äôll tell you how many points per week you need to get there. <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/introducing-the-wen-goat-app/37331?u=gm5alx">Several people</a> have tried it out and had fun with it. My most recent update included doing the calculation for subsequent Mountain Goat awards, i.e.&nbsp;those that already have 1,000 points or more and are working their way towards the next 1,000 mark.</p>
<p>I had fun making it, and Streamlit makes it so easy to get online. Visit it at this link, and here‚Äôs an embedded version below - although it‚Äôs not the greatest experience that way.</p>

<p>Fraser, MM0EFI, and Tim, G5OLD, were going out to <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-019/">Conachcraig</a> today and asked who else was going out. I was keen to go (as always) but lots of family activities were going to limit me. So what better way to solve it, than to bring the kids with me!</p>

<p>It was a bit cold, around 0-1 ¬∞C when we set off. Everyone was excited to go at home, but when we got there everyone was complaining! We made reasonable time to the top, and I setup the tent for the kids so they could keep out of the wind and have their snack in comfort. I setup on 2m by the edge of the fort remains to try and keep out of the wind.</p>

<p>Fraser and Tim just came on 2m as I was setup and so had two summit to summits with them. Sounded a lot snowier and colder with them. Then had a succession of chasers on 2m. I did hear someone on a HEMA summit work Fraser but I never worked them. My HT was on dual channel monitoring and I kept hearing someone talking on 145.150 but I couldn‚Äôt remember how to turn that off or change the secondary channel, so that was distracting. I was going to setup on HF but it was a bit cold and the kids probably wouldn‚Äôt have lasted much longer. Also seems the base of the tent isn‚Äôt waterproof anymore and several were complaining of wet areas.</p>

<p>Originally, Gerald, G4OIG, was coming to visit the area and do some summits, so we‚Äôd arranged all to go out today. However, Gerald ended up not being able to make it, but after posting on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-winter-activity-day-friday-7-february-2025/37340">forum</a>, we now had quite a list of summits expected to be activated in GM. It could possibly be the most at once in Scotland.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>I set off after dropping the kids and school and headed out to my summit. Carn na Drochaide is right at the ‚Äúend of the line‚Äù, so it took a while to get to the start. There are a few routes up and I was taking the shortest, as I was trying to meet the 11:30 time.</p>

<p>The weather was absolutely spectacular! Chilly, around -5¬∞C at the car park, but no wind and lovely blue skies. The path is generally good, although comes and goes in places - or maybe that‚Äôs me from the path - and some heather bashing is required. Carn Dearg ascent gives you a bit of a false hope, as you then descend a little before climbing the final summit. As I was heading up 2m was starting up as the others were on their summits and calling CQ. I checked in with the <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/GM0ESS">GM0ESS</a> callsign, and said I‚Äôd be at the top soon. The views were starting to become very good as I climbed, with all the big peaks becoming visible.</p>

<p>I reached the AZ just after 11:30, and heard G5OLD calling on 2m, and so he was the first S2S in the log. After our brief chat I was at the summit cairn, and started working the other activators. Four in the log on the HT and whip, and I started to setup the slim g on the mast. I‚Äôd also brought the Kenwood V71 for a little more power.</p>

<p>With virtually no wind on the summit, a few rocks held the 7m mast in place and I had the sun warming my back as the air was still cold. I started setting up HF, had the wire up and just about to plug in when I heard @MM0FMF on 2m, who I‚Äôd spoken to before I was at the summit, and was glad to make a contact, as my first complete of the day. I then carried on on 2m working three more summits, including MM7DCD on what sounded like a very wet and windy Ben Lomond, GM/SS-011. My second complete of the day (after only just <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-ss-011/">activating it</a> in the Christmas holidays). Was also great to get Barry, GM4TOE, on GM/ES-084, the Grandfather of GM/ES‚Ä¶just look at the first activator of pretty much any GM/ES summit.</p>
<p>17 QSOs on 2m of which 12 were summit to summits! So there was at least 13 GM summits today‚Ä¶I wonder if we beat the previous record set in <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-winter-activity-day-friday-7-february-2025/37340/46">August 2012</a>? I shall look into that later.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Another lovely day and this time a quick outing to The Buck. <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-039/">Not a new summit</a> for me, but a good one on points/hour ratio! The subtitle for this post is <em>The Bog</em>, and even on a cold day like today, it‚Äôs still a bog at the bottom. Probably best to do when the ground is frozen, then you‚Äôre not hopping from tuft to tuft trying not to get soaked feet.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a quick one, about 40 minutes to the top. The SOTA chat group were all about and I had a few 2m QSOs with them before I setup my new AX1 for the KX2, to try and use it like a HF HT!</p>

<p>I was using the AX1 for 20m - it can do 15m and 17m and then 30m/40m with the extension coil. Probably does 10m too. You have a counterpoise wire that trails along the ground - which for 40m is pretty long! I had it attached straight into the BNC connector on the KX2, and I was going to use internal mic. I did wear headphones as it was a bit windy and I wanted to be sure I could hear. The idea was to use it in one hand and then log with the other.</p>

</div>
<p>It was my first time, but it was also quite awkward. I hadn‚Äôt realised the PTT, XMIT button, was toggled, so I have to press it against to unkey, and the button isn‚Äôt in the easiest place to press. I ended up putting my phone on the trig point, holding the KX2 in the right hand and then using my left hand to press the XMIT button, I also had to shelter the KX2 in my shadow to minimise wind noise. Probably would‚Äôve helped if I wasn‚Äôt standing right on the summit, and found somewhere sheltered but the whole point was to do it from right at the top! I got used to it, and managed 18 QSOs on 20m.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve done this with the coil for 40m, it would feel very unstable with all that weight on the BNC. I do want to use it again, as it‚Äôs quick to setup. I am thinking that perhaps a headset and PTT button might be easiest, one where I could hold it in my hand and use that had to key up. Alternatively, I could get an elbow BNC and set it up on the ground or backpack etc. and just use the regular mic. I‚Äôll try one of these again some other time. Was a good activation and with a quick trot down the hill I was back home in no time.</p>

<p>Last time I didn‚Äôt see the pict markings of the three fish. Not sure how as it was right in front of the summit as you come down! Probably circa 400-900 AD.There is also a small visitor book hidden in one of the walls nearby, that I forgot to look for‚Ä¶so next time!</p>

<p>I headed over to Tarland and the Douneside Hotel were I was going to park for the ascent. Fraser, MM0EFI, was off up <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-059/">Kerloch</a> and was going to arrive at 2:30pm. My route up was the longest of the day, and I estimated around an hour to get to the top, and so had to get a march on to make sure I was on time! In the end it only took me 45 minutes but I was quite tired when I got to the top!</p>

<p>The cloud had been moving further east, but so had I, and I was still enjoying the blue skies, particularly if I looked towards Aberdeen. I got a bit lost going through the Tarland trails mountain biking course and ended up walking along some of it and then between it as a few bikes were about. On the way back down I realised I should‚Äôve walked further away from the summit to find the footpath, but on the way up I was trying to take the most direct route possible!</p>

<p>The views were still good, I particularly liked <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-018/">Morven</a>. I got to the top just before Fraser was on the summit and I called CQ on my HT. I managed to work him and then 3 more stations around. I had originally thought about setting up HF, but it was getting on and I needed to get home, so with the minimum 4 QSOs to qualify I headed back down the hill and home again. 15 points today, 3 new summits and a complete on Kerloch.</p>

<p>The middle hill of the day and just a short drive from Ladylea. Again, a fairly short route up, following the signs and path. Someone else and their dog had been up before me, as I was following their footsteps the whole way.</p>

<p>There were still jet planes flying around and whilst you can‚Äôt really see them, this picture has them just at the peak of the hill in the far distance. I didn‚Äôt quite manage to zoom in on my phone before they were gone. It‚Äôs still a nice view even without them.</p>

<p>Once you round the path to the base of the heather hill, you do find there are several paths up to the top. The sign posts take you the longest way around, but there are several tracks leading straight up. So after following the path for a bit, I decided to head across the heather and join one of these tracks leading up to the summit. There are a few trees at the top, so this would be a good summit on a windy day. As with Ladylea, there was hardly any wind at all, and I setup right on the trig.</p>

<p>The trig point has a few wooden planks around it, that act like benches, so you can get quite comfy up here, as long as the wind isn‚Äôt too cold. I‚Äôd called on 2m first, and then moved onto 40m. Not masses of activity but perfectly pleasant enough on both bands getting some contacts. As I spoke with Fraser, MM0EFI, he said he was heading to Kerloch to climb that. I was meant to be doing a summit to summit with him on my next peak, so I quickly got packed up and headed down through the trees on a more direct path back to the car.</p>

  <title>Ladylea Hill</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Another day off, and some more SOTA summits to activate! Today I wanted to knock off some 2-pointers with winter bonus that I‚Äôve not climbed before. First on the list was Ladylea Hill. I did have some concerns when driving to Ladylea and droves of tweed men with hounds were scratching around with shotguns looking for turkeys or something. Luckily they were a couple of hills over and I wasn‚Äôt going to get shot.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="ladylea-1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Parking area"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-049/ladylea-1.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Parking area"></a></p>

<p>It seems anything west of Morven was covered with snow and Ladylea was one of those. The main concern was parking, and not being able to get the car out once I returned to it. So I just parked on the verge pointing downhill, even though there is a nice off road parking area. The ascent is pretty quick and I was soon on the summit. There was no wind whatsoever and the wire didn‚Äôt even flinch on the mast. Whilst it was chilly it was very pleasant in the sun. The clouds were over the high peaks and it did gradually moved east during the day.</p>

<p>On the way down from Ladylea, a path leading straight down was too tempting as a shortcut - especially as I still had two more to go. I looked at the map and whilst the path didn‚Äôt return to the road, there was just a short stretch of forest to walk through, so I figured ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. It started well, making good progress down the hill, until I came to the forest, surrounded by fencing. I did spy a gap under it, which I had to literally crawl through!</p>

<p>That was only the start of my problems, as the forest was thick fallen trees, and I had to scramble over and under them to make any progress, but by this time I wasn‚Äôt going to go back up the hill now. So I pushed on.</p>

<p>Eventually I made it through and out onto the road, where I walked back to the car. Looking at my route and satellite imagery, I do wonder if it would‚Äôve been better to walk further south and avoid the trees. Although at the time I don‚Äôt remember it looking clear.</p>

  <title>145 Alive Net</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>145 Alive is a scheme to promote 2m activity in the UK. Most of the organisation is done online via a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/906901577214402/?locale=en_GB">facebook group</a>. They co-ordinate dates and frequencies of nets that people volunteer to do. This year Chris, 2M0RVZ, and I were going to run a net and park on the Cairn O‚ÄôMount. However, the snow gates were still closed this morning and turned out to have fallen trees on the road. We could approach it from the south but we didn‚Äôt know the conditions, so changed to Garvock hill near Laurencekirk. At the last 145 Alive event I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-087/">Waughton Hill</a> and called into a couple of nets, this time I was going to be running one!</p>

<p>Chris has a newly converted Land Rover which has a pop up roof, and comfy seating in the back. Plus a heater, kettle, running water‚Ä¶ the works! So we were going to spend a couple of hours in that and see who we could get.</p>

<p>We were using a slim G up a 10m mast, and I‚Äôd brought my 50W Kenwood V71 FM radio. Chris had an ecoflow power bank, although the radio kept restarting when we keyed up, so we swapped to my golf buggy battery. We were set up quickly and then discussed strategy for handling the net. The net was 12-3pm, and at 12:00pm we were ready to call CQ.</p>
<p>We did hear a station down in East Lothian who was overlapping with another net, and also us, on the same frequency but he couldn‚Äôt hear us then disappeared.</p>
<p>We were using the new GM/ES SOTA Society callsign of GM0ESS for today - as there were two of us, and our first CQ went out and ‚Ä¶ nothing üòÖ</p>

<p>After a while a few stations did start calling in and we managed about 12 in total, even had a couple who could work each other. Many times we had one station to our North and one to our South and they couldn‚Äôt hear each other. We also called into the Dundee net and had a couple more contacts there. It was quite relaxed and we chatted and ate and drank in between times. I was glad we weren‚Äôt sat out on a hillside, as we‚Äôd have packed up after 4 contacts for the summit!</p>

<p>I had to get back home by 2:30pm, so I left about 1:50pm, Chris kept going for another half an hour but didn‚Äôt manage to work anyone else. Either his 10W from his IC-705 wasn‚Äôt enough, or just no-one was listening!</p>
<p>Was a fun afternoon, and quite relaxing as there wasn‚Äôt really any net to manage üòÖ Plus got to check out the fancy Land Rover. The events are usually on Sunday and I can‚Äôt always get out then, so not sure if I‚Äôll run one again, or just climb up a hill and call in.</p>

  <title>Mount Keen</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-lazy-guide-to-cyprus/37279/19">living it large in Cyprus</a> for a week, with lunchtime beers and drive on summits, Fraser MM0EFI, was looking to do some real walking for fear of turning into another passenger on the Axiom. Earlier in the week he‚Äôd asked if anyone was interested in an outing on Wednesday. I was planning on going out Friday but then Fraser pointed out the weather forecast and I rearranged things accordingly.</p>

<p>If you hadn‚Äôt guessed, Mount Keen, GM/ES-014, was our destination, and we were climbing from Glen Tanar. This is a longer route than the one from the other side in Glen Esk, however, it‚Äôs much nearer both our houses, particularly Fraser‚Äôs, and I wanted to try it. It‚Äôs a bike and hike route, about an hour of each. You could walk but it‚Äôs a long way, about 15 km each way (Glen Esk route is 9 km each way and that feels like a long walk).</p>

<p>It is uphill most of the way, but the gradient is fairly shallow that it‚Äôs not a slog. The first part is through a nice forest of Caledonian scots pinewoods and past a frozen loch, although it was still quite dark so not much of it could be admired.</p>

<p>We reached the bridge at the base of the climb and decided to leave our bikes here. You could ride/push your bike up the path someway to have a quicker route down but it seemed unnecessary and Fraser told me of a time where he got a puncture doing just this. Preparing for the hike</p>

<p>Things were going okay for the first 10 minutes but then Fraser seemed to be falling behind and huffing and puffing. Turned out he had bad cramp in his leg and couldn‚Äôt shake it off - even a packet of Haribo didn‚Äôt cure him. With a few stops we pressed on to the top.</p>

<p>The summit was covered in thick frost and a little slippery underfoot. After admiring the views and remarking that even Lochnagar was lacking in snow we started to set up our stations. Fraser was on 2m with his HT and yagi, and I was on HF with the KX2 and 41‚Äô of wire.</p>
<p>Fraser had a good run on 2m FM, with 10 contacts from around Scotland.</p>

<p>I started on 40m, which was noisy and a bit slow. I then switched to 20m and that was absolutely popping. The pile up was crazy, just a wall of noise coming back to me each time. My particular highlight was a HB9 QSO which was 59 both ways. The other guy tells me he‚Äôs running 1.5 kW, and I reply with ‚Äú10W here!‚Äù. I probably could‚Äôve continued for another hour non-stop. I managed to work through about 40 of them before I was too cold and needed to pack up. Thankfully there was still no wind on the summit, otherwise I would‚Äôve stopped after 40m! Fraser had Jack, GM4COX, on when I was finishing up they were having a good yaggin (yakking with a yagi?).</p>

<p>We hadn‚Äôt seen anyone all morning but at the summit a couple of people came by. I was buried on 20m so didn‚Äôt look up but Fraser acted as the Mount Keen, Cairngorms and amateur radio tour guide. Particularly to a guy who had just climbed Mount Keen as his first Munro.</p>
<p>We‚Äôd been on the summit about an hour and both content with our activations. The joy of radio seemed to have cured Fraser‚Äôs ailments and he was hopping and skipping again. Plus it was downhill all the way, and the bike section only took 30 minutes on the way back. This time we could admire the loch and forest before returning to the car park.</p>
<p>Fraser invited me back for lunch, and promptly called Mo to let her know to set the table for more one, and ‚Äúyes, he is normal‚Äù. After admiring the array of Land Rovers in Fraser‚Äôs drive, we were ushered into the dining room for a very fine lunch. Think that‚Äôs two lunches I owe you now!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had to pull myself free of the sofa, fire and tea to head back home to do my half day‚Äôs work.</p>

<p>Whilst the route is longer, and more to ascend, I think I like it more than Glen Esk. The view of Mount Keen as you approach, the forest cycle, and the nice track up to the top are the best parts. Plus I suspect it‚Äôs slightly quieter than the other way.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Back in March last year, I set out on my <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-061/">first SOTA activation</a>. As it‚Äôs a new year, you can activate summits again and get the points, and with the winter bonus a 2-point summit is 5 point. As I was heading out in the afternoon, this was a nice quick one for the morning.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>The weather was nicer this time than my last climb, although still windy on the top. I took the same route up from the Back O‚ÄôBennachie car park. There were quite a few other walkers about this morning. Chris, 2M0RVZ, was heading up Ben Aigan, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-069">GM/ES-069</a>, so hopefully we‚Äôd get a 2m summit to summit.</p>

</div>
<p>It‚Äôs a quick route up and I was ready about 10:15, just in time for Chris arriving for our 2m QSO. Simon, GM4JXP, was also on 2m but he couldn‚Äôt hear Chris and was keen to get a complete for Aigan. The wind was strong on the summit, so I was looking for somewhere sheltered and also out the main route with other walkers coming and going. I found a good spot just south of the summit down the side of the summit.</p>

<p>Just like my first visit, I brought the G90, although this time a much small and lighter battery! Another chase by Fraser, 5B/M0EFI, from Cyprus on 15m, we compared his EFHW and the 41‚Äô wire. Both were about the same and probably more variation in propagation than anything else, but perhaps the 41‚Äô was slightly better. I moved onto 40m, and then 20m before looking for other summits to chase. I had a nice QSO with Esther, EI4KT, who was out in the north of Ireland (not to be confused with Northern Ireland!) By this time I‚Äôd been on the air about an hour and whilst I was in a sheltered spot I was getting cold and stiff legs.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The final summit of the day. As I had time, I thought I‚Äôd do this one as I knew it would be a quick walk. There are a few 1 pointers in this area which I‚Äôd like to activate eventually, and this helped tick it off my list.</p>

<p>It seems a popular spot for dog walkers as the ‚Äúcar park‚Äù was nearly full when I arrived. A wind farm has been built on the hill, so it‚Äôs made up roads nearly to the top. It‚Äôs also a very gentle gradient of hardly any climb, so pushing the very limits of the definition of summit. It took less than 20 minutes to reach the summit, a few well balanced stones.</p>

<p>I went back to the road to make use of the snow markers as a support for the mast and setup. Fraser wanted to try and make a contact as he wanted Knockan for a complete (where you activate and chase a summit). Quite the lengths to get a complete whilst on holiday in Cyprus! We tried 15m to start and he was pretty good this time, 43 to me. After that I started looking around for other summits but I was wasting time and just wanted to get it qualified and done, so moved to 20m and soon had a nice run for 5 minutes before calling it quits. Takes longer to setup and take down the station than get to the top! Back to the car in no time and away home.</p>

  <title>Little Conval</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After packing up from it‚Äôs bigger sibling, Meikle Conval, I set off towards Little Conval. Little meaning 18m shorter. The route is straight forward, follow the path down Meikle and then up Little. The activation area is quite large and there are several cairns on the top. Not sure if the cairn I stood at was the summit but close enough!</p>

<p>The wind was still strong and there was even less shelter on this summit. I spotted a tree a little down the side of the hill, which looked ideal for a mast support and perhaps a wind break. I setup by it, and enjoyed looking out at the two hills I‚Äôd already climbed. The wind did stop at times and it was really quite warm when it did.</p>
<p>Fraser was back at his hotel after his activation and wanted to try and chase. We tried 10m but nothing and then 15m. I only called CQ once and a Polish guy jumped in and had a chat for a bit! It took a few goes with Fraser but eventually just managed a QSO, although somewhat supported by the WhatsApp chat to say if we could hear anything or not. I went back to 10m and tried it, getting a couple of contacts, then back on 15m before chasing a Spanish summit, EA6/MA-005 and deciding that was enough.</p>

<p>There are two routes back, one is back up and over Meikle Conval again, and the second is around the side of it and along the road. I think the over the hill route is shorter and maybe quicker but I decided to go around. It did end with about 1-1.5km along the road, which was a bit boring. The RAF mountain rescue group were just returning to the road, after they must‚Äôve done the big loop over Ben Rinnes and towards Baby‚Äôs Hill and back to the road.</p>
<p>As I was back in good time, I decided to tick off one of the local 1-pointers.</p>

<p>After Ben Rinnes, I stopped at the car for some of my super noodles in my new food thermos. They were nice and warm and tasted good! The group I passed on my way down turned out to be the RAF Mountain rescue, presumably out for a walk as well.</p>

<p>The path up Meikle Conval starts just opposite the Ben Rinnes gate, it‚Äôs a small track so not immediately noticeable. The track up is quite steep and you gain elevation quickly.</p>

<p>The route up is straight forward, following the path until you reach the summit. There isn‚Äôt much of a cairn or shelter at the top and it was windy at the top. I‚Äôd forgotten to try 2m on Ben Rinnes, so I started out with it here. After a couple of CQs, Johnny, GM7LSI, in Elgin came back to me. We had a little chat whilst I looked for a good place to setup. Johnny was my only 2m contact, so I just setup on HF.</p>

<p>There was a slight depression at the top, which looked good to setup in. This time I used the longer wire for 40m and had a good run of QSOs, including a S2S with G4OOE/P on G/TW-004.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A big trip out planned for today. Ben Rinnes, the two Convals and then, if time, a wee 1-pointer to finish the day. I had to drop my daugther at swimming at 6:30, so I was on the road straight after that. Fraser, MM0EFI, was on holiday in Cyprus as 5B/M0EFI and had been doing SOTA summits all week. Today was no different and he was going to be out and on the summit at 0900 UTC, so no hanging around for me!</p>

<p>It was still dark when I set off but the slow sunrise started to illuminate the terrain. There were still big patches of snow, and the path seemed to be a natural drift area. I tried to walk across it and sank down in the snow to my waist! There were also places where the snow had melted underneath due to run off water coming down the hill, so you‚Äôd stand on the snow, sink through it and end up in a stream. After the first part of the ascent the snow was all gone and it was just the track with small patches.</p>

<p>I made good time to the top, it took me just under an hour. The wind was strong on the summit and after a quick selfie and admiring the view I started to look for somewhere sheltered to set up. It was about 8:50 and I wanted to be ready for Fraser.</p>

<p>I found a nice spot where I could hide behind an outcrop and also some rocks to wedge the mast in. I was using the 5.5m vertical and the KX2. I was all setup when the wind shook the mast so that it collapsed in on itself. I fixed it back, wedging the sections has much as I could, and then messaged Fraser to say for I was ready. Fraser had luck with Simon, GM4JXP, on previous summits on 10m and 15m, so those were the bands we were going to try. After a couple of calls I heard Fraser, as 5B/M0EFI/P, quite clearly and we made our summit to summit QSO!</p>

<p>I moved over to 20m band and worked some more stations. Also had a summit to summit with Mark, GD5MUP, who was on holiday in Tenerife up EA8/TF-010. A few more QSOs and then I packed up and headed down. It was nice to get out of the wind and the sun had come up more so the surroundings were well lit up to admire.</p>
<p>I met a group coming up the hill, who I later realised was the RAF Mountain Rescue group, and one of them had the same waist deep experience in the snow drifts!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks since I last went out, and with the holidays I didn‚Äôt get any other opportunities until the work and school cycle started again. I had a few errands to do, I was visiting some kittens! in St.&nbsp;Cyrus in the morning, plus we were leaving after school to travel for a wedding, so my timing was very restricted. When I was planning the trip, I didn‚Äôt think I had time, or at best I‚Äôd only be back just in time. I managed to tear myself away from the kittens at 11am, and decided to go for it. I was worried the road to the start of the summit would be snowy or icy, but the snow wasn‚Äôt too bad down in Angus compared to Aberdeen.</p>

<p>There are a couple of routes up Hill of Wirren, and I‚Äôd picked the shortest from the entrance to Auchowrie farm. I also wanted to go straight up vs.&nbsp;the route north and around the ridge. There‚Äôs a quad track the whole way up, even where the map says the track stops, it‚Äôs still there. The route starts off as the road up to the farm, and whilst you could walk through the farm to join the track, it felt a little rude to do so, and so I went up to the mobile phone mast, crossed the gate and then rejoined the track.</p>

<p>The snow was patchy most of the way up until around 500 or 550m, and then it was more consistent. Most of the 450-odd meter ascent was a consistent straight up, and the gradient didn‚Äôt let up until you reached the top plateau. The wind was fairly light but when it did blow it was cold, and the air temperature was probably near freezing.</p>

<p>It took me around an hour to get to the top, which does have a large activation zone, and I started calling on 2m as I closed in on the trig. I had three quick QSOs from Edinburgh and Aberdeen and with the wind, cold and time pressure I started to hope for a fourth to qualify the summit and head back down. After a few CQs and no replies, I thought it was best to start setting up on HF. The trig point has a post next to it, although a frozen puddle next to it, which looks boggy during warmer seasons. I was going to just setup on the trig, with the trig hole for the mast but by the time I‚Äôd unraveled the antenna, I had a QSO with Chris, 2M0RVZ, north of Aberdeen. So with my four, I packed up and headed down.</p>

<p>I was down quickly, although not as quick as if I‚Äôd brought a sledge! It was fun to run down the snow whilst it was still deep, but once it thinned out, it was a little slippy. I made it home in plenty of time and finished all my jobs.</p>

  <title>Cairngorms National Park SOTA Summits</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2025/sota-summits-in-the-cairngorms/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Cairngorms park is a pretty big place. You tend to think of just the mountains in the middle but it covers around 4,500 km^2 or nearly 1,750 sq miles. It has a <a href="https://cairngorms.co.uk/">dedicated website</a> with lots of information if you‚Äôre interested.</p>
<p>Whilst I‚Äôm trying to activate and qualify all 87 GM/ES sota summits, I also wondered about all the summits within the Cairngorms. This extends into CS and WS. Using a <a href="https://cartographyvectors.com/map/1359-cairngorms-national-park">Cairngorms GeoJSON file</a>, and the summit lists from the <a href="https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/association/GM">sota database</a> I was able to find those within the park.</p>
<p>I think there are 89 summits: 46 in ES, 40 in CS, and 3 in WS. Below is a map to explore and also a list. <a href="cairngorms_summits.csv">Here‚Äôs a CSV of them</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve made a Cairngorms Climbers‚Äô award, and you can see the details of it <a href="https://cairngorms.streamlit.app/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We were staying nearby with family for Christmas and I‚Äôd been looking on the map at the summits near their house. Quite a few good ones and many are hardly activated. The weather hadn‚Äôt been great over the Christmas period, mostly wet, either raining or just very damp - although it always seems wet here but maybe that‚Äôs just because I live on the east coast. If it was nicer we would‚Äôve all gone up Conic Hill (<a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-239">GM/SS-239</a>) during the week. The family were off to Moana 2, and I was given the option of coming or not‚Ä¶! I thought about the two 2 pointers nearby, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-117">Beinn Uird</a> and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-124">Binnean nan gobhar</a>. The latter having not been activated since 2016! They‚Äôre like GM/ES summits with only 7 and 6 activations. It would‚Äôve given me 10 points and probably taken the same amount of time. However, the draw of another Munro - the most southerly one - was too much and those two summits are maybe better with the kids in the future.</p>

<p>It was just 20 minutes to Rowardennan where the Ben Lomond car park is, and for ¬£5 you can stay all day. I dread to think what this is like in the height of summer, as the car park is tiny and it was quite full on a miserable December day. There is overflow parking further away which you pass on the road in. The route is straight forward and well marked. There‚Äôs even a water bottle refill station!</p>

<p>I took the eastern route up to the top, and the path is very good nearly the entire way, with just a few small sections of walking up rock face. I met quite a few folk coming down and overtook several going up. Not sure all of them were well prepared‚Ä¶ A group of young individuals from Glasgow stopped and had a brief chat with me. Whilst they‚Äôd come down from the summit, they were still pretty high! üö¨üåø</p>

<p>It‚Äôs quite a hike vertically, from sea level to 974m, although most is at a nice gradient. The views were non-existent, and maybe around 500 m I was in the cloud. It wasn‚Äôt raining though, so that was a plus. Pretty much after 2 hours I reached the top.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a nice grassy part to the NE of the summit which drops away and helps you keep out the wind. I setup my carbon 6 with slim g there and called on 2m. Two guys and a boy, who I‚Äôd passed on the way up, came over when they heard the radio but quickly dismissed me once they saw. 2m was lively and I had several mobile stations in their cars, and then a summit to summit with Andy, MM7MOX, over on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-209">Broomy Law</a>. After a run of 8, I called CQ a few more times but no replies. I thought about HF but I was actually soaking wet as the water was condensing on me from the clouds, and so I decided not to bother and just head back. I wanted to do the loop and so looked around for the path down on the other side.</p>

<p>The pictures don‚Äôt do it justice, but it‚Äôs quite a steep and rocky route on this side just past the summit. In fact this way is much more adventurous than the side I took up. I think if anyone is uncertain or with kids, then I‚Äôd suggest going up and down the eastern route only. Probably climbing up the western side is better than going down. The route was fine on the way down, again, no views for much of the way, until maybe around 400m when I came out of the clouds and they‚Äôd cleared a little on the Loch.</p>

<p>We were driving down to family for Christmas, and needed to take two cars. I was in the electric and on my own. Managed to make it to Perth to the fast chargers there and assumed I‚Äôd be having lunch on my own whilst the others went out when they arrived. I had thought of doing <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-192">Craigowl Hill</a> on the way down but decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it as it was raining on the way past. Plus I‚Äôm not sure I would‚Äôve had enough charge for the detour. Whilst charging I looked at sotlas and decided I‚Äôd do Stronend as I drove by. It has a reasonable walk in, estimated at 1.5 hours, but I thought I could shave a bit of time off that. It was very convenient browsing the summits on <a href="https://sotl.as/">sotlas</a> and then downloading someone‚Äôs GPS track and opening it in OS Maps.</p>

<p>The route follows a farm track for quite a while, you go back on yourself from the layby parking, up to the farm, and then along the track. It takes you up between the two hills, and then across a stream and on towards the summit. The track is decent at the bottom but the higher you go the wetter it seems to get!</p>

<p>My boots were pretty soaked as I squelched along. It wasn‚Äôt raining but the air was damp and the cloud was low, so not much of a view. The path is pretty clear the whole way to the summit, although with a few forks that I had to check the map to make sure I was taking the right one. The summit cairn came into sight and I was pleased to have reach the top.</p>

<p>It has a nice cairn at the top, offering plenty of shelter from the wind. There‚Äôs a trig point that is covered, or maybe built?, with cobbles. Conveniently the top was open and so I used that for my mast support. I setup the slim G for 2m, spotted and called CQ. Not quite a HF pile up but several folks returned my call at once, and in about 2 minutes I had five in the log and was satisfied. Given it was now 2pm, I thought I‚Äôd better make a move and packed up. I jogged down most of the way to try and make up some time. I was soon back to the main track, however, it felt slow going to get back to the car. I was pretty soaked, my boots aren‚Äôt particularly waterproof, and the dampness had seeped into my top layers. I got changed and then headed to the house.</p>

<p>The second hill of today, which is just across the River Don from the first. I was taking the route up from Littlewood house, parking in a layby on the road by the Don. I didn‚Äôt like walking along the road so I cut through the trees to join the road up to the big house. It was a bit wet and probably only saved 2 minutes, so perhaps not worthwhile!</p>

<p>You walk past the house and then past various outbuildings until you join a land rover track up the hill. At this point I could hear a lot of shooting going on across the other side of the estate. I was slightly concerned that I would be stopped and told to go back but it seemed I was heading in the opposite direction and should be fine. Once I got past the trees and and heading up the hill I was well away from it all. You never know with shoots going on what to expect, and generally should stay away, but there were no signs or barriers. Often when going to the big hills, the places put up barriers or tell you to stick to the paths. Probably, as this was a smaller estate, and most likely don‚Äôt have very much walker traffic, don‚Äôt bother with that. By the time I got past the trees the shooting had stopped and there was a lot of car activity as I guess they were heading back for lunch.</p>

<p>The path continues up the hill and you can see the trig and summit cairn. The trig is a little exposed, so after having a look at it and trying 2m, I went over to the cairn. This is a substantial one, which you can hide in, although it seems to trap cold air and felt chilly and damp inside, so I setup on the leeward side of the cairn out of the wind. I jammed the mast into the rocks and setup the vertical for 20m. After 10 minutes or so the mast moved and started to fall, so I sat with my back against it to hold it up. 20m was very lively, with strong signals into Wales and England and good into Europe. I even had a east coast US come back as 55.</p>

<p>This is the last day of school before the Christmas holidays and I wanted to try and fit in two 5 (with winter bonus) point summits. My spreadsheet timetable suggested there wasn‚Äôt quite enough time to fit in both, but I knew I could jog down the hills to save time and I didn‚Äôt typically use all the 45 minutes I allocated to being on the radio. First up was Coiliochbhar. There‚Äôs the route I took from the west and also another from the south. My route follows a land rover track much of the way up until you get to a big gate. This is where the estate owner is trying to encourage pheasants for shooting, and makes you take a detour around it. The path around isn‚Äôt very well developed, so a bit of heather bashing at times.</p>

<p>At the top, there‚Äôs a cairn to your left and a fence line that leads into some trees. After a look at the cairn, I got the HT out and tried 2m. It was nice to get the WhatsApp group on 2m as I walked towards the trees. It was only three so I had to setup on HF, but that was fine. I setup in the trees, offering shelter from the wind but also making for easy mast support, and setup for 40m.</p>

<p>I had a summit to summit with a German ham, and a nice run on 40m. It did start to rain, so I packed up and headed down. On the way I met a game keeper, who asked if I could avoid visiting outside of Feb-Aug due to the pheasants. I guess I‚Äôll leave it until Feburary before I come back again - and perhaps take the southern route too to avoid the pheasant breeding area. It was a short 10 minute drive up to the main road ready for the next one!</p>
