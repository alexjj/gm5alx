My wife and I had a trip away for the weekend, and I suggested a nice walk nearby...which of course was a SOTA summit! We were staying new St. Andrews, which is quite a flat area however, there are a few granite lumps you can climb. Today's one was Largo Law. If the weather was good, we'd have a lovely view of the Forth, Edinburgh and Esat Lothian. However, that wasn't the case today...more like grey and cloudy.

The route is straight forward, as shown on [Sotlas](https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-259), park at the school/cemetary, up towards the farm and then straight up the hill! The track was tricky in places as the ground was dry and covered in loose soil, but we made it up fine.

I setup the slim g on the 6m carbon mast, put out a spot and called CQ. It took a few calls but stations did start coming back. Good coverage across Glasgow, Edinburgh and up to Montrose area. Had a nice chat with GM4PKJ, who lives
