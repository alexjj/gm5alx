After [Hill of Fare](/sota/2024/gm-es-070/), I drove across to Benaquhallie, and [parked](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a8nNR6BCH9RMpJiQ7) by the side of an old farm building. There's not really much space to park, and I think the house is still occupied so you can't block the road, but maybe two cars could park there.

The route up is fairly easy going, you walk east in front and around the summit before turning back on yourself and climbing up to the top. There's a trig point where the summit marker is but then down the hill a little, along that path, is the cairn.

I started with 2m at the trig point and managed 3, and then another 3 on 70cm. Meanwhile Chris, MM7RVP, was up Cairn-mon-earn and calling CQ on 2m as well. The four of us could hear him but he seemed to struggle to recieve. Like [I did](/sota/2024/gm-es-080/), there's quite a bit of QRM from the communications towers there and I think his handheld was getting overloaded.

I setup the Slim G to see if that would help get through the Chris, but no luck again. So I took it down and setup HF. I did manage to get Chris on both 40m and 20m, for our summit to summit. I then called on 20m and ended up with another 11 EU contacts, including a summit to summit in Switzerland.

I was pleased to manage two summits in one day. I had to be back for school pickup so timing wise it worked out quite well. There was a 1:20 gap between my last contact on Hill of Fare and my first on Benaquhallie, so these pair are a good combo, espeically if you can activate on VHF/UHF!

Mike, 2M0WMA, also taught us all, over the air, how to pronounce Benaquhallie. It's something like "ben-a-whallie", but with some good accent on the Wh. I think I was the only whallie that day.
