I headed over to Tarland and the Douneside Hotel were I was going to park for the ascent. Fraser, MM0EFI, was off up [Kerloch](https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-059/) and was going to arrive at 2:30pm. My route up was the longest of the day, and I estimated around an hour to get to the top, and so had to get a march on to make sure I was on time! In the end it only took me 45 minutes but I was quite tired when I got to the top!

The cloud had been moving further east, but so had I, and I was still enjoying the blue skies, particularly if I looked towards Aberdeen. I got a bit lost going through the Tarland trails mountain biking course and ended up walking along some of it and then between it as a few bikes were about. On the way back down I realised I should've walked further away from the summit to find the footpath, but on the way up I was trying to take the most direct route possible!

The views were still good, I particularly liked [Morven](https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-018/). I got to the top just before Fraser was on the summit and I called CQ on my HT. I managed to work him and then 3 more stations around. I had originally thought about setting up HF, but it was getting on and I needed to get home, so with the minimum 4 QSOs to qualify I headed back down the hill and home again. 15 points today, 3 new summits and a complete on Kerloch.

The summit does have a nice big cairn, and posts giving plenty of mast and shelter options.
