The last day of the winter bonus in GM land, and so I was looking for places where I could do multiple summits - it doesn't matter which ones, as long as they're 2 or more points, as I'll probably visit them all this year. However, I also had to be back for school pick up and I don't think any of the pairs of summits left could be done in time. So I settled on Creag Bhalg and then do one of the one pointers on the way home. I'd chased Simon on here during the winter GM/ES activation day, and so it would be a good complete for me.

The suggested route has you park opposite Victoria bridge and walk over it - cars aren't allowed over - and this is quicker than parking at Linn of Dee or further along somewhere. It means you walk through the estate a little before crossing the road and starting the climb up the hill.

The path is clear and straight forward to follow the whole way to the top.

There is a nice cairn at the top for antenna mounting and also for sheltering from the wind, which was absolutely freezing today. Once I was setup, I could crouch down behind the cairn and started on 40m.

I had a nice steady stream on 40m, and once that died down I was cold enough and thinking about the schedule that I packed up and headed back down. The views were good, a little cloud, so not quite full panoramic views but enjoyable nevertheless.

The route back down was easy too and I was soon back at the car and getting ready to set off for my next one.
