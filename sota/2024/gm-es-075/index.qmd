Another [hill](https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-075), this time to the south of Aberdeen. The weather was wet and windy in the morning, particularly so inland, so thought Iâ€™d stick to the coast. The two options were Strathfinella or [Hill of Garvock](https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-085). Reports of angry cows from Garvock, plus the sheltered nature of the wooded summit of Strathfinella made the decision for me.

Consulting Fraser, [MM0EFI](https://youtube.com/@theradiorover), the local SOTA expert, I was going to climb it from the south, following forestry roads and mountain bike paths. Looked to be fairly short route and a quick claim to the top. Itâ€™s only a one pointer, so never going to be that far.

The weather was pretty good, breezy but some sun and mild. The route was straightforward- literally. There were a few bikers around who I met just before the turn off to the summit.

I had a chat with some of the mountain bikers but just said I was out for a walk. Too much effort to get into the real reason! They pointed me towards the trig point which was off to the side of the main path. I almost missed it whilst walking along! Itâ€™s right in the trees, and reminded me of the portal stones from the Realm of the Enderlings book series!

I set up 2m first and got a guy down in Brechin, unfortunately he was the only 2m QSO. I spent a long time calling and then decided to move to HF.

The summit is a bit of a black spot for mobile reception and I wasnâ€™t prepared for that. I use my phone for 2m spotting and for SOTA spotting or looking up other activators. Iâ€™ve signed up and registered for APRS to SOTA, and SOTAMAT, a FT8 spotter, and maybe even a SMS one, but do I know how to use them?! ðŸ˜…

I eventually managed to spot myself on 40m and got a few contacts. 20m spot did work but no one ever came back to meâ€¦even though Iâ€™d had a few contacts with other callers.

I managed two S2S contacts in Germany. One was an exchange of 11-31 each way but we managed to get my callsign and SOTA reference communicated.

On the way down I thought about doing Hill of Garvock but I hadnâ€™t packed lunch and still had to get back home. Maybe a double activation next time!
