After Ben Rinnes, I stopped at the car for some of my super noodles in my new food thermos. They were nice and warm and tasted good! The group I passed on my way down turned out to be the RAF Mountain rescue, presumably out for a walk as well.

The path up Meikle Conval starts just opposite the Ben Rinnes gate, it's a small track so not immediately noticeable. The track up is quite steep and you gain elevation quickly.

The route up is straight forward, following the path until you reach the summit. There isn't much of a cairn or shelter at the top and it was windy at the top. I'd forgotten to try 2m on Ben Rinnes, so I started out with it here. After a couple of CQs, Johnny, GM7LSI, in Elgin came back to me. We had a little chat whilst I looked for a good place to setup. Johnny was my only 2m contact, so I just setup on HF.

There was a slight depression at the top, which looked good to setup in. This time I used the longer wire for 40m and had a good run of QSOs, including a S2S with G4OOE/P on G/TW-004.

I packed up and then set off for the next Conval.
