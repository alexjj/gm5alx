Took two of the kids with me on this one. They were keen for an adventure! Even packed their own bags with toys and random things, including ice cream and tea sets for a picnic on the summit. We parked in Donview forest car park and followed the red route up. Quite a steep bit near the start with wooden steps that the kids started counting, but then eased off and a more gentle climb after that. Nice and sheltered in the trees for much of the way. When we did get near the summit the wind was blowing an absolute gale - which everyone found amusing. We hunkered down behind a rock and the kids has their snack and picnic and I tried 2m FM. Managed three and then was worried I wouldn't get my fourth. Heard MM0EFI calling but he couldn't hear me, so I walked over the summit to the west side, just holding the pole with the slim G waving as the wind was blowing and then managed the QSO and even one more after that. Glad I didn't have to get out HF as I think the kids had had enough of me messing about. Plus we had to be back in time for swim training.

The walk down was much easier, the little one started getting tired half way down but kept soldering on. We went into Kemney in search of a cafe for lunch but they were all closed except one. That one was mobbed and looked too fancy for us, so we had a picnic in the car from the Co-op!

Little one is keen to go again and packed several backpacks in the garage, so will have to see what's next for us.
