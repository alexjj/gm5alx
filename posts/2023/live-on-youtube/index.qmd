Was on the computer doing things and switched tabs to YouTube and I saw Callum, M0XXT, of DXCommander, doing a live stream on 40m. Thought I might as well give him a call.

My antenna was unplugged, as it comes in through the window and now itâ€™s getting chilly in the mornings, so I had to nip out to get that sorted. I donâ€™t know why I was in a rush, he was on for hours, but always a chance heâ€™d move on to 20m for EU/US stations. This meant I was still on 25 W from last time I used the radio for FT8 when I called him. Now, 25W to 100W is only 6 dB (notionally an S point), so in some respects not a big deal, but you never know and sometimes it can make a difference.

He heard me just fine, 56. I meant to tell him he was 59 but forgot with telling him my name and location â€“ he gets a bit frustrated when people donâ€™t tell him their name ðŸ˜… â€“ and thought Iâ€™d say it on the next over, but I didnâ€™t get one. Not that it mattered at all.

20 seconds of fame. [Hereâ€™s the link](https://youtu.be/E7xtEfKut-8?t=1472) to the moment if the embed ignores that.

So now my QSO is immortalised by Google on YouTube.

Is this the radio equivalent of being behind a reporter on a live TV show? I donâ€™t know, but a bit of fun anyway.
