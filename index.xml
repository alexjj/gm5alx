  <title>145 Alive Net</title>

<p>145 Alive is a scheme to promote 2m activity in the UK. Most of the organisation is done online via a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/906901577214402/?locale=en_GB">facebook group</a>. They co-ordinate dates and frequencies of nets that people volunteer to do. This year Chris, 2M0RVZ, and I were going to run a net and park on the Cairn O’Mount. However, the snow gates were still closed this morning and turned out to have fallen trees on the road. We could approach it from the south but we didn’t know the conditions, so changed to Garvock hill near Laurencekirk. At the last 145 Alive event I was on <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-087/">Waughton Hill</a> and called into a couple of nets, this time I was going to be running one!</p>

<p>Chris has a newly converted Land Rover which has a pop up roof, and comfy seating in the back. Plus a heater, kettle, running water… the works! So we were going to spend a couple of hours in that and see who we could get.</p>

<p>We were using a slim G up a 10m mast, and I’d brought my 50W Kenwood V71 FM radio. Chris had an ecoflow power bank, although the radio kept restarting when we keyed up, so we swapped to my golf buggy battery. We were set up quickly and then discussed strategy for handling the net. The net was 12-3pm, and at 12:00pm we were ready to call CQ.</p>
<p>We did hear a station down in East Lothian who was overlapping with another net, and also us, on the same frequency but he couldn’t hear us then disappeared.</p>
<p>We were using the new GM/ES SOTA Society callsign of GM0ESS for today - as there were two of us, and our first CQ went out and … nothing 😅</p>

<p>After a while a few stations did start calling in and we managed about 12 in total, even had a couple who could work each other. Many times we had one station to our North and one to our South and they couldn’t hear each other. We also called into the Dundee net and had a couple more contacts there. It was quite relaxed and we chatted and ate and drank in between times. I was glad we weren’t sat out on a hillside, as we’d have packed up after 4 contacts for the summit!</p>

<p>I had to get back home by 2:30pm, so I left about 1:50pm, Chris kept going for another half an hour but didn’t manage to work anyone else. Either his 10W from his IC-705 wasn’t enough, or just no-one was listening!</p>
<p>Was a fun afternoon, and quite relaxing as there wasn’t really any net to manage 😅 Plus got to check out the fancy Land Rover. The events are usually on Sunday and I can’t always get out then, so not sure if I’ll run one again, or just climb up a hill and call in.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-lazy-guide-to-cyprus/37279/19">living it large in Cyprus</a> for a week, with lunchtime beers and drive on summits, Fraser MM0EFI, was looking to do some real walking for fear of turning into another passenger on the Axiom. Earlier in the week he’d asked if anyone was interested in an outing on Wednesday. I was planning on going out Friday but then Fraser pointed out the weather forecast and I rearranged things accordingly.</p>

<p>If you hadn’t guessed, Mount Keen, GM/ES-014, was our destination, and we were climbing from Glen Tanar. This is a longer route than the one from the other side in Glen Esk, however, it’s much nearer both our houses, particularly Fraser’s, and I wanted to try it. It’s a bike and hike route, about an hour of each. You could walk but it’s a long way, about 15 km each way (Glen Esk route is 9 km each way and that feels like a long walk).</p>

<p>0730 was our rendezvous time, and after debating how many layers to wear - it was about -4°C - we set off along the nice tracks.</p>

<p>It is uphill most of the way, but the gradient is fairly shallow that it’s not a slog. The first part is through a nice forest of Caledonian scots pinewoods and past a frozen loch, although it was still quite dark so not much of it could be admired.</p>

<p>Out of the forest and you’re greeted with the hills surrounding Mount Keen. All the snow in the area has completely gone, with only very minor patches left, and this morning the white was the frost.</p>

<p>Soon enough Mount Keen came into view, although looked like the summit was in the clouds. Hopefully we wouldn’t be too early and suffer those clouds.</p>

<p>We reached the bridge at the base of the climb and decided to leave our bikes here. You could ride/push your bike up the path someway to have a quicker route down but it seemed unnecessary and Fraser told me of a time where he got a puncture doing just this. Preparing for the hike</p>

<p>Things were going okay for the first 10 minutes but then Fraser seemed to be falling behind and huffing and puffing. Turned out he had bad cramp in his leg and couldn’t shake it off - even a packet of Haribo didn’t cure him. With a few stops we pressed on to the top.</p>

<p>The summit was covered in thick frost and a little slippery underfoot. After admiring the views and remarking that even Lochnagar was lacking in snow we started to set up our stations. Fraser was on 2m with his HT and yagi, and I was on HF with the KX2 and 41’ of wire.</p>
<p>Fraser had a good run on 2m FM, with 10 contacts from around Scotland.</p>

<p>I started on 40m, which was noisy and a bit slow. I then switched to 20m and that was absolutely popping. The pile up was crazy, just a wall of noise coming back to me each time. My particular highlight was a HB9 QSO which was 59 both ways. The other guy tells me he’s running 1.5 kW, and I reply with “10W here!”. I probably could’ve continued for another hour non-stop. I managed to work through about 40 of them before I was too cold and needed to pack up. Thankfully there was still no wind on the summit, otherwise I would’ve stopped after 40m! Fraser had Jack, GM4COX, on when I was finishing up they were having a good yaggin (yakking with a yagi?).</p>

<p>We hadn’t seen anyone all morning but at the summit a couple of people came by. I was buried on 20m so didn’t look up but Fraser acted as the Mount Keen, Cairngorms and amateur radio tour guide. Particularly to a guy who had just climbed Mount Keen as his first Munro.</p>
<p>We’d been on the summit about an hour and both content with our activations. The joy of radio seemed to have cured Fraser’s ailments and he was hopping and skipping again. Plus it was downhill all the way, and the bike section only took 30 minutes on the way back. This time we could admire the loch and forest before returning to the car park.</p>
<p>Fraser invited me back for lunch, and promptly called Mo to let her know to set the table for more one, and “yes, he is normal”. After admiring the array of Land Rovers in Fraser’s drive, we were ushered into the dining room for a very fine lunch. Think that’s two lunches I owe you now!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had to pull myself free of the sofa, fire and tea to head back home to do my half day’s work.</p>
<p><a href="keen-1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-17"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-014/keen-1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>Whilst the route is longer, and more to ascend, I think I like it more than Glen Esk. The view of Mount Keen as you approach, the forest cycle, and the nice track up to the top are the best parts. Plus I suspect it’s slightly quieter than the other way.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Back in March last year, I set out on my <a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-061/">first SOTA activation</a>. As it’s a new year, you can activate summits again and get the points, and with the winter bonus a 2-point summit is 5 point. As I was heading out in the afternoon, this was a nice quick one for the morning.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<p>The weather was nicer this time than my last climb, although still windy on the top. I took the same route up from the Back O’Bennachie car park. There were quite a few other walkers about this morning. Chris, 2M0RVZ, was heading up Ben Aigan, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-069">GM/ES-069</a>, so hopefully we’d get a 2m summit to summit.</p>

<p>It’s a quick route up and I was ready about 10:15, just in time for Chris arriving for our 2m QSO. Simon, GM4JXP, was also on 2m but he couldn’t hear Chris and was keen to get a complete for Aigan. The wind was strong on the summit, so I was looking for somewhere sheltered and also out the main route with other walkers coming and going. I found a good spot just south of the summit down the side of the summit.</p>

<p>Just like my first visit, I brought the G90, although this time a much small and lighter battery! Another chase by Fraser, 5B/M0EFI, from Cyprus on 15m, we compared his EFHW and the 41’ wire. Both were about the same and probably more variation in propagation than anything else, but perhaps the 41’ was slightly better. I moved onto 40m, and then 20m before looking for other summits to chase. I had a nice QSO with Esther, EI4KT, who was out in the north of Ireland (not to be confused with Northern Ireland!) By this time I’d been on the air about an hour and whilst I was in a sheltered spot I was getting cold and stiff legs.</p>

<p>The final summit of the day. As I had time, I thought I’d do this one as I knew it would be a quick walk. There are a few 1 pointers in this area which I’d like to activate eventually, and this helped tick it off my list.</p>

<p>It seems a popular spot for dog walkers as the “car park” was nearly full when I arrived. A wind farm has been built on the hill, so it’s made up roads nearly to the top. It’s also a very gentle gradient of hardly any climb, so pushing the very limits of the definition of summit. It took less than 20 minutes to reach the summit, a few well balanced stones.</p>

<p>I went back to the road to make use of the snow markers as a support for the mast and setup. Fraser wanted to try and make a contact as he wanted Knockan for a complete (where you activate and chase a summit). Quite the lengths to get a complete whilst on holiday in Cyprus! We tried 15m to start and he was pretty good this time, 43 to me. After that I started looking around for other summits but I was wasting time and just wanted to get it qualified and done, so moved to 20m and soon had a nice run for 5 minutes before calling it quits. Takes longer to setup and take down the station than get to the top! Back to the car in no time and away home.</p>

<p>After packing up from it’s bigger sibling, Meikle Conval, I set off towards Little Conval. Little meaning 18m shorter. The route is straight forward, follow the path down Meikle and then up Little. The activation area is quite large and there are several cairns on the top. Not sure if the cairn I stood at was the summit but close enough!</p>

<p>The wind was still strong and there was even less shelter on this summit. I spotted a tree a little down the side of the hill, which looked ideal for a mast support and perhaps a wind break. I setup by it, and enjoyed looking out at the two hills I’d already climbed. The wind did stop at times and it was really quite warm when it did.</p>
<p>Fraser was back at his hotel after his activation and wanted to try and chase. We tried 10m but nothing and then 15m. I only called CQ once and a Polish guy jumped in and had a chat for a bit! It took a few goes with Fraser but eventually just managed a QSO, although somewhat supported by the WhatsApp chat to say if we could hear anything or not. I went back to 10m and tried it, getting a couple of contacts, then back on 15m before chasing a Spanish summit, EA6/MA-005 and deciding that was enough.</p>

<p>There are two routes back, one is back up and over Meikle Conval again, and the second is around the side of it and along the road. I think the over the hill route is shorter and maybe quicker but I decided to go around. It did end with about 1-1.5km along the road, which was a bit boring. The RAF mountain rescue group were just returning to the road, after they must’ve done the big loop over Ben Rinnes and towards Baby’s Hill and back to the road.</p>
<p>As I was back in good time, I decided to tick off one of the local 1-pointers.</p>

<p>After Ben Rinnes, I stopped at the car for some of my super noodles in my new food thermos. They were nice and warm and tasted good! The group I passed on my way down turned out to be the RAF Mountain rescue, presumably out for a walk as well.</p>

<p>The path up Meikle Conval starts just opposite the Ben Rinnes gate, it’s a small track so not immediately noticeable. The track up is quite steep and you gain elevation quickly.</p>

<p>The route up is straight forward, following the path until you reach the summit. There isn’t much of a cairn or shelter at the top and it was windy at the top. I’d forgotten to try 2m on Ben Rinnes, so I started out with it here. After a couple of CQs, Johnny, GM7LSI, in Elgin came back to me. We had a little chat whilst I looked for a good place to setup. Johnny was my only 2m contact, so I just setup on HF.</p>

<p>There was a slight depression at the top, which looked good to setup in. This time I used the longer wire for 40m and had a good run of QSOs, including a S2S with G4OOE/P on G/TW-004.</p>

  <title>Ben Rinnes</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A big trip out planned for today. Ben Rinnes, the two Convals and then, if time, a wee 1-pointer to finish the day. I had to drop my daugther at swimming at 6:30, so I was on the road straight after that. Fraser, MM0EFI, was on holiday in Cyprus as 5B/M0EFI and had been doing SOTA summits all week. Today was no different and he was going to be out and on the summit at 0900 UTC, so no hanging around for me!</p>

<p>It was still dark when I set off but the slow sunrise started to illuminate the terrain. There were still big patches of snow, and the path seemed to be a natural drift area. I tried to walk across it and sank down in the snow to my waist! There were also places where the snow had melted underneath due to run off water coming down the hill, so you’d stand on the snow, sink through it and end up in a stream. After the first part of the ascent the snow was all gone and it was just the track with small patches.</p>

<p>I made good time to the top, it took me just under an hour. The wind was strong on the summit and after a quick selfie and admiring the view I started to look for somewhere sheltered to set up. It was about 8:50 and I wanted to be ready for Fraser.</p>

<p>I found a nice spot where I could hide behind an outcrop and also some rocks to wedge the mast in. I was using the 5.5m vertical and the KX2. I was all setup when the wind shook the mast so that it collapsed in on itself. I fixed it back, wedging the sections has much as I could, and then messaged Fraser to say for I was ready. Fraser had luck with Simon, GM4JXP, on previous summits on 10m and 15m, so those were the bands we were going to try. After a couple of calls I heard Fraser, as 5B/M0EFI/P, quite clearly and we made our summit to summit QSO!</p>

<p>I moved over to 20m band and worked some more stations. Also had a summit to summit with Mark, GD5MUP, who was on holiday in Tenerife up EA8/TF-010. A few more QSOs and then I packed up and headed down. It was nice to get out of the wind and the sun had come up more so the surroundings were well lit up to admire.</p>
<p>I met a group coming up the hill, who I later realised was the RAF Mountain Rescue group, and one of them had the same waist deep experience in the snow drifts!</p>

<p>It’s been a couple of weeks since I last went out, and with the holidays I didn’t get any other opportunities until the work and school cycle started again. I had a few errands to do, I was visiting some kittens! in St.&nbsp;Cyrus in the morning, plus we were leaving after school to travel for a wedding, so my timing was very restricted. When I was planning the trip, I didn’t think I had time, or at best I’d only be back just in time. I managed to tear myself away from the kittens at 11am, and decided to go for it. I was worried the road to the start of the summit would be snowy or icy, but the snow wasn’t too bad down in Angus compared to Aberdeen.</p>

<p>There are a couple of routes up Hill of Wirren, and I’d picked the shortest from the entrance to Auchowrie farm. I also wanted to go straight up vs.&nbsp;the route north and around the ridge. There’s a quad track the whole way up, even where the map says the track stops, it’s still there. The route starts off as the road up to the farm, and whilst you could walk through the farm to join the track, it felt a little rude to do so, and so I went up to the mobile phone mast, crossed the gate and then rejoined the track.</p>

<p>The snow was patchy most of the way up until around 500 or 550m, and then it was more consistent. Most of the 450-odd meter ascent was a consistent straight up, and the gradient didn’t let up until you reached the top plateau. The wind was fairly light but when it did blow it was cold, and the air temperature was probably near freezing.</p>

<p>It took me around an hour to get to the top, which does have a large activation zone, and I started calling on 2m as I closed in on the trig. I had three quick QSOs from Edinburgh and Aberdeen and with the wind, cold and time pressure I started to hope for a fourth to qualify the summit and head back down. After a few CQs and no replies, I thought it was best to start setting up on HF. The trig point has a post next to it, although a frozen puddle next to it, which looks boggy during warmer seasons. I was going to just setup on the trig, with the trig hole for the mast but by the time I’d unraveled the antenna, I had a QSO with Chris, 2M0RVZ, north of Aberdeen. So with my four, I packed up and headed down.</p>

<p>I was down quickly, although not as quick as if I’d brought a sledge! It was fun to run down the snow whilst it was still deep, but once it thinned out, it was a little slippy. I made it home in plenty of time and finished all my jobs.</p>

  <title>Cairngorms National Park SOTA Summits</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://gm5alx.uk/posts/2025/sota-summits-in-the-cairngorms/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Cairngorms park is a pretty big place. You tend to think of just the mountains in the middle but it covers around 4,500 km^2 or nearly 1,750 sq miles. It has a <a href="https://cairngorms.co.uk/">dedicated website</a> with lots of information if you’re interested.</p>
<p>Whilst I’m trying to activate and qualify all 87 GM/ES sota summits, I also wondered about all the summits within the Cairngorms. This extends into CS and WS. Using a <a href="https://cartographyvectors.com/map/1359-cairngorms-national-park">Cairngorms GeoJSON file</a>, and the summit lists from the <a href="https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/association/GM">sota database</a> I was able to find those within the park.</p>
<p>I think there are 82 summits: 44 in ES, 36 in CS, and 2 in WS. Below is a map to explore and also a list. <a href="cairngorms_summits.csv">Here’s a CSV of them</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve made a Cairngorms Climbers’ award, and you can see the details of it <a href="https://cairngorms.streamlit.app/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We were staying nearby with family for Christmas and I’d been looking on the map at the summits near their house. Quite a few good ones and many are hardly activated. The weather hadn’t been great over the Christmas period, mostly wet, either raining or just very damp - although it always seems wet here but maybe that’s just because I live on the east coast. If it was nicer we would’ve all gone up Conic Hill (<a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-239">GM/SS-239</a>) during the week. The family were off to Moana 2, and I was given the option of coming or not…! I thought about the two 2 pointers nearby, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-117">Beinn Uird</a> and <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-124">Binnean nan gobhar</a>. The latter having not been activated since 2016! They’re like GM/ES summits with only 7 and 6 activations. It would’ve given me 10 points and probably taken the same amount of time. However, the draw of another Munro - the most southerly one - was too much and those two summits are maybe better with the kids in the future.</p>

<p>It was just 20 minutes to Rowardennan where the Ben Lomond car park is, and for £5 you can stay all day. I dread to think what this is like in the height of summer, as the car park is tiny and it was quite full on a miserable December day. There is overflow parking further away which you pass on the road in. The route is straight forward and well marked. There’s even a water bottle refill station!</p>

<p>I took the eastern route up to the top, and the path is very good nearly the entire way, with just a few small sections of walking up rock face. I met quite a few folk coming down and overtook several going up. Not sure all of them were well prepared… A group of young individuals from Glasgow stopped and had a brief chat with me. Whilst they’d come down from the summit, they were still pretty high! 🚬🌿</p>

<p>It’s quite a hike vertically, from sea level to 974m, although most is at a nice gradient. The views were non-existent, and maybe around 500 m I was in the cloud. It wasn’t raining though, so that was a plus. Pretty much after 2 hours I reached the top.</p>

<p>There’s a nice grassy part to the NE of the summit which drops away and helps you keep out the wind. I setup my carbon 6 with slim g there and called on 2m. Two guys and a boy, who I’d passed on the way up, came over when they heard the radio but quickly dismissed me once they saw. 2m was lively and I had several mobile stations in their cars, and then a summit to summit with Andy, MM7MOX, over on <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-209">Broomy Law</a>. After a run of 8, I called CQ a few more times but no replies. I thought about HF but I was actually soaking wet as the water was condensing on me from the clouds, and so I decided not to bother and just head back. I wanted to do the loop and so looked around for the path down on the other side.</p>

<p>The pictures don’t do it justice, but it’s quite a steep and rocky route on this side just past the summit. In fact this way is much more adventurous than the side I took up. I think if anyone is uncertain or with kids, then I’d suggest going up and down the eastern route only. Probably climbing up the western side is better than going down. The route was fine on the way down, again, no views for much of the way, until maybe around 400m when I came out of the clouds and they’d cleared a little on the Loch.</p>

<p>We were driving down to family for Christmas, and needed to take two cars. I was in the electric and on my own. Managed to make it to Perth to the fast chargers there and assumed I’d be having lunch on my own whilst the others went out when they arrived. I had thought of doing <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/SS-192">Craigowl Hill</a> on the way down but decided it wasn’t worth it as it was raining on the way past. Plus I’m not sure I would’ve had enough charge for the detour. Whilst charging I looked at sotlas and decided I’d do Stronend as I drove by. It has a reasonable walk in, estimated at 1.5 hours, but I thought I could shave a bit of time off that. It was very convenient browsing the summits on <a href="https://sotl.as/">sotlas</a> and then downloading someone’s GPS track and opening it in OS Maps.</p>

<p>The route follows a farm track for quite a while, you go back on yourself from the layby parking, up to the farm, and then along the track. It takes you up between the two hills, and then across a stream and on towards the summit. The track is decent at the bottom but the higher you go the wetter it seems to get!</p>

<p>My boots were pretty soaked as I squelched along. It wasn’t raining but the air was damp and the cloud was low, so not much of a view. The path is pretty clear the whole way to the summit, although with a few forks that I had to check the map to make sure I was taking the right one. The summit cairn came into sight and I was pleased to have reach the top.</p>

<p>It has a nice cairn at the top, offering plenty of shelter from the wind. There’s a trig point that is covered, or maybe built?, with cobbles. Conveniently the top was open and so I used that for my mast support. I setup the slim G for 2m, spotted and called CQ. Not quite a HF pile up but several folks returned my call at once, and in about 2 minutes I had five in the log and was satisfied. Given it was now 2pm, I thought I’d better make a move and packed up. I jogged down most of the way to try and make up some time. I was soon back to the main track, however, it felt slow going to get back to the car. I was pretty soaked, my boots aren’t particularly waterproof, and the dampness had seeped into my top layers. I got changed and then headed to the house.</p>

<p>The second hill of today, which is just across the River Don from the first. I was taking the route up from Littlewood house, parking in a layby on the road by the Don. I didn’t like walking along the road so I cut through the trees to join the road up to the big house. It was a bit wet and probably only saved 2 minutes, so perhaps not worthwhile!</p>

<p>You walk past the house and then past various outbuildings until you join a land rover track up the hill. At this point I could hear a lot of shooting going on across the other side of the estate. I was slightly concerned that I would be stopped and told to go back but it seemed I was heading in the opposite direction and should be fine. Once I got past the trees and and heading up the hill I was well away from it all. You never know with shoots going on what to expect, and generally should stay away, but there were no signs or barriers. Often when going to the big hills, the places put up barriers or tell you to stick to the paths. Probably, as this was a smaller estate, and most likely don’t have very much walker traffic, don’t bother with that. By the time I got past the trees the shooting had stopped and there was a lot of car activity as I guess they were heading back for lunch.</p>

<p>The path continues up the hill and you can see the trig and summit cairn. The trig is a little exposed, so after having a look at it and trying 2m, I went over to the cairn. This is a substantial one, which you can hide in, although it seems to trap cold air and felt chilly and damp inside, so I setup on the leeward side of the cairn out of the wind. I jammed the mast into the rocks and setup the vertical for 20m. After 10 minutes or so the mast moved and started to fall, so I sat with my back against it to hold it up. 20m was very lively, with strong signals into Wales and England and good into Europe. I even had a east coast US come back as 55.</p>

<p>I packed up and headed back down to the car. I was home an hour ahead of my schedule, which was good to then have a cup of tea before collecting everyone from school for Christmas holidays! 🎅</p>

<p>This is the last day of school before the Christmas holidays and I wanted to try and fit in two 5 (with winter bonus) point summits. My spreadsheet timetable suggested there wasn’t quite enough time to fit in both, but I knew I could jog down the hills to save time and I didn’t typically use all the 45 minutes I allocated to being on the radio. First up was Coiliochbhar. There’s the route I took from the west and also another from the south. My route follows a land rover track much of the way up until you get to a big gate. This is where the estate owner is trying to encourage pheasants for shooting, and makes you take a detour around it. The path around isn’t very well developed, so a bit of heather bashing at times.</p>

<p>At the top, there’s a cairn to your left and a fence line that leads into some trees. After a look at the cairn, I got the HT out and tried 2m. It was nice to get the WhatsApp group on 2m as I walked towards the trees. It was only three so I had to setup on HF, but that was fine. I setup in the trees, offering shelter from the wind but also making for easy mast support, and setup for 40m.</p>

<p>I had a summit to summit with a German ham, and a nice run on 40m. It did start to rain, so I packed up and headed down. On the way I met a game keeper, who asked if I could avoid visiting outside of Feb-Aug due to the pheasants. I guess I’ll leave it until Feburary before I come back again - and perhaps take the southern route too to avoid the pheasant breeding area. It was a short 10 minute drive up to the main road ready for the next one!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theradiorover">Fraser</a> was off today and asked if I was around for a summit. I managed to rearrange work things so I could go out in the morning and catch up later. The forecast was showing strong winds and potentially rain. Luckily the rain never really happened, but boy, was the wind strong!</p>

<p>It’s a nice route through the forest and then along the top with good views across to Lochnagar. It took us about 1:15 to get to the summit. The final summit has two peaks, one with a cairn and one without. The wind was so strong here that we stuck at the cairn site. I setup down the leeway slope out of the wind a little.</p>
<p>I’d managed to leave my phone in my car, and so had to get Fraser to spot. This also meant no photos of the trip…Guess I’ll have to go back again! I also had to use paper logging for the first time, but managed okay!</p>

<p>Fraser setup at the cairn and was on 40m. We didn’t stay that long and soon got off the summit. We did check out the other side and the wind was insane over there, I could hardly stand and if I’d taken out my bothy bag I reckon I could’ve taken off. We headed back down and then into Ballater for a second breakfast.</p>
<p>Fraser has done a nice write up of our trip on the <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-twin-peaks-and-a-gale/37019">reflector</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been eyeing Hunt Hill, <a href="https://sotl.as/summits/GM/ES-042">GM/ES-042</a>, for a while, but wanted a relatively calm day, as judging from previous reports and the internet, there isn’t much shelter on the summit. It’s also on my list of summits I can do when I have to do both school drop off and pick up. I decided to take the normal (<a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/the-thrill-of-the-hunt/30925">not stupid?</a> - again, relative! 🧑‍🔬) route from Glen Esk.</p>

<p>I had my bike and would cycle to the footbridge over the Lee, then head straight up and across to the summit. For my return, I wanted to see the waterfalls and so walk down to the Falls of Damff and then follow the water and path back to the bike - easy!</p>

<p>It was glorious sunshine and blue skies in Aberdeen and all the way there…until about 3 miles from the car park, when the cloud or fog came in. I was optimistic that the summit would still be in the sun and this was just some valley mist.</p>

<p>The cycle is along a nice track and relatively flat the whole way. Whilst the scenery was stunning, you can still enjoy it on a bike and save a lot of time! I dumped the bike in the heather just before the footbridge. The ground before and after the bridge was sheet ice, so some careful maneuvering to get on and off the bridge was required!</p>

<p>It’s a balance of taking a longer route and going further away from the summit, but gentler gradient and trying to take a shortcut but end up facing more and more vertical sections. No surprises what route I tried.</p>

<p>As I climbed higher the amount of snow increased, and in places it covered large sections of the hillside. It did mean the peat hags were filled in with snow and I could skip across them. Interestingly most of the snow was on the southern side of the hill.</p>
<p><a href="hunthill-17.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-9"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-042/hunthill-17.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>As required under the obligations of climbing GM/ES, Fraser MM0EFI, was looking for a complete, and so we were hopeful on 2m. He was working but that doesn’t usually stop him from nipping out for a quick QSO. I’d alerted for 11:30am and needed to be on time, so that Fraser could serve the real workers of Westhill their christmas dinner. I was ready by 11:30 but Fraser was busy, so I admired the view whilst eating my chicken roll.</p>

<p>Fraser let me know he was on his way, and I just put out a call and we managed to work whilst he was still in the car park! I did call further on 2m but all quiet. So I switch to HF. There was a slight breeze on the summit, and the air was cold, so I wasted some time wandering about seeing if there was a better spot that offered a bit of shelter. I decided there wasn’t and just got on with it. I setup for 40m, spotted and called CQ. It took a few goes calling CQ before anyone replied. Recently there are already several stations waiting after I do my first call. However, the chasers soon started and I had a nice steady stream, offering the chance for a quick chat beyond the usual RST and thanks. I think the surrounding beauty reflected in my voice as several commented on how cheerful I was. Or something like that.</p>

<p>10 minutes on the air and after the faffing about at the start, I was running short on time, and decided not to try chasing summits and pack up, and continue my route. This didn’t start well as I proceeded to march off in the completely wrong direction as I’d “seen the stream” and knew where to go. I had seen a stream but it was the Burn of Damff to the west, rather than the falls to the south. I wasn’t too far off and reoriented back the right way.</p>

<p>A classic cause of issues at work is “time pressure”, people making bad choices because they are or think they are short on time. That was me and the thought of school pick up in a few hours time.</p>

<p>I’m not stupid. I’ll take a shortcut.</p>

<p>I could see and hear the waterfalls below and without looking at any map decided I could join the path from here. Perhaps I should’ve taken advice from <a href="https://reflector.sota.org.uk/t/gm-es-042-hunt-hill-12th-september-2018/18687">others before me 4</a>…</p>

<p>There was one moment where I came to a dead end, and the only way to go was edge past a huge boulder on about 20 cm of grass above a 5-6m drop. Of course it wasn’t the only way, I could go back the way I came but you know…tick tock tick tock ⌚👀. In this moment the wise words of my wife came into my head, and I, too, thought “this is stupid”. 🤦</p>

<p>I pressed on and made it 😅 and soon reached the path by the water. The small streams running off the hill top made some impressive icicles on the rock faces, and the waterfalls were impressive and loud!</p>

<p>Back to the bike through a very chilly gully. I met another hiker admiring the views at the footbridge and he shared some of his adventures over the years in the area.</p>

<p>The cycle back was speedy, it’s slightly downhill the whole way, and home with enough time for a cup of tea before the school bell rings!</p>

<p>We were up in Inverness for a swimming competition and I wondered if there were any summits I could manage. Luckily this one is only about 15 minutes from the pool and a fairly short walk up to the top. I dropped off for warm up and then headed up the hill. I’d read it was a bit of a soggy climb, and after the storm the past few days, there was a lot of water around. The path was more like a stream and in places there was deep standing water. It really only got better when climbing to the final top.</p>

<p>The final section of the walk doesn’t really have a path up to the summit, the track just continues around the hill and away, so it was a case of scrambling up the heather and trying to avoid the streams coming down. It was cold but still on the way up, but as soon as I was on the summit the wind was strong. I found a low spot with a post and some shelter and setup on 20m there. As I wanted to be quick, I was going for the 5.5m vertical with counterpoises.</p>

<p>Not too busy on 20m, but enough in the log with 9 QSOs. I packed up and headed down the way I came and back to Inverness.</p>
<p>Some good views of the hills from the summit and from the parking area. I’ll come back next time I’m in the area, particularly if it’s during winter bonus!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In my wisdom to save walking 200m down the road to the start of the track, I decided to just head straight up the hill. Well this turned into a very wet affair, and I gradually made my way across to the path, like I should’ve from the start.</p>

<p>After the drive over the Mount Blair and looking at the summit with clear blue skies backdrop, the cloud started to move in and blue became grey.</p>

<p>Some SSE folks were up doing things on the mast. They’d come up in their 8 wheeled buggy, some kind of Argocat. They were finishing up as I was looking at the trig and other features. They gave me a cheerful wave as they tootled past to go down the hill.</p>

<p>Lots of fences and rocks and all sorts to setup on the top. I decided to the south of the main mast by the fence would be good. As I had no guys, I needed something decent to strap the mast to, and setup on 40m. I had a quick QSO with Gerald again, who was on his way down, and I wanted to make this quick as it had started raining and the cold wind wasn’t enjoyable. Not as busy on the band as Monday but enough.</p>

<p>Packed up and headed back down to the car. I’d hoped Gerald and I could’ve found a nice cafe or bar to say hello, but there aren’t many options in the area. In fact, none as far as I could tell. There is the Glenisla Hotel, although that seems to shut its bar/cafe out of season on non-Friday/weekend days. So I waited by the car for Gerald to come by. We had a little chat and nice to put a face to a voice! Then off back home.</p>
<p>It’s a nice area with lots of good hills in close proximity. It would make for a good group SOTA outing - perhaps doing two hills each and rotating around, then back to the hotel bar for a celebration afterwards.</p>
<p>Now I’ve got to try and get back down there to Crock, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-056">GM/ES-056</a>, Hare Cairn, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-063">GM/ES-063</a>, Corwharn, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-048">GM/ES-048</a>, and maybe even Cat Law, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-044">GM/ES-044</a>, before the winter bonus period ends!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="gulabin-13.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-077/gulabin-13.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>After quite the adventure on <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-040">G</a><a href="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/">M/ES-040</a>, and reports from Fraser as he drove down of Glenshee being quite the white, we were wondering what might be in store. Again, a look at the snow gate cameras showed us it had all gone! The Glenshee camera shows you the side of Ben Gulabin. Gerald was heading up Corwharn, <a href="https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/GM/ES-048">GM/ES-048</a>, and I on Ben Gulabin. Somewhere between Mount Blair and Gulabin the quickest route from west Aberdeen flips from via the A90 to the A93, and so I drove the scenic route. The route up Gulabin is another straight forward one. Park off the road by the start and follow the path up.</p>
<p><a href="gulabin-12.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-077/gulabin-12.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>There’s a bit of a stream to cross, and then quite a boggy area once you turn left off the track up to the summit. Probably made worse by the just recent snow melt.</p>
<p><a href="gulabin-8.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-077/gulabin-8.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>What started as another lovely morning, had started to turn a little. The wind was cold and the clouds were creeping in. It was still nice enough on Ben Gulabin but this would be the best of the day.</p>
<p><a href="gulabin-3.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-6"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-cs-077/gulabin-3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I came to setup on 2m, and found I’d left my guys at home. This was even more annoying as they were in my bag from yesterday, and I’d gone through everything this morning before leaving and obviously left them on the garage floor. So I held the mast and carried on. It didn’t take too long to get four, and then speak with Gerald on his summit. His phone hadn’t been charging properly and so was dead, which meant he couldn’t spot. However, he shared his info and I could spot for him on 2m SSB, which worked out well. After that I packed up and headed back to the car and drive round to the start of Mount Blair.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Fraser shared last night that the snow gates were shut due to the snow. When the sun came up this morning, it was a glorious sunny, crisp, cold day with amazing views of the hills. At 8:30am when I was about to leave the gates were still shut…I was going with a work friend up the hill and he felt confident the gates would be opened by 10. After passing endless signs telling me the road was closed, and finally at 10:15 am when I arrived at Cock Bridge…they were still shut. My friend was about 15 minutes behind me, and so I waited for him by Corgarff Castle.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-28.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-28.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I’d looked at an alternative route to the summit from here, in case the gates were closed. It is possible but it’s twice as far, at around 18.5 km <em>each way</em>.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-27.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-27.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>This was too far for my friend and if I was going to do it, he’d maybe only come part way. I was also trying to calculate how long we’d be and if I’d get back home in time for birthday tea with the family! As we were chatting we heard a loud rumbling of a gritter coming along the road. We watched him go up past the trees to where the gate is…road noise stops…engine quietens…CLANG! of metal against metal… that would be the gates being opened! So we headed back and got to the snow gates and sure enough he’d opened them and was heading up. He gave us the thumbs up and we followed.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-23.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-23.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>Once he opened the gates at the ski centre we were off to Tomintoul. We parked in the village opposite the hotel, rather than the parking on the route, mostly to be certain we could drive in and out again, and got ready to roll. At 9.9 km each way, this was a much more reasonable distance, and on a good day (i.e.&nbsp;not today) would probably only take about an hour to 1:15hrs to ride.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-26.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-4"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-26.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>The track down to the bridge (around 5 km) was absolutely treacherous with ice and in some places was just sheet ice across the whole track. I only fell off once and somehow managed to do a magic trick of falling onto my feet in a standing position as the bike slid out from under me and away down the road. We dropped our seats, put out our feet as stablisers and skated down some parts of it. The track is also quite undulating and several ups and downs to make you groan.</p>
<p>I just happened to check my phone and saw Fraser had spotted. We were down in the valley by the river and I didn’t expect much luck (although I was getting phone signal of course), and put out a call to him. He was in a QSO with GM0HLV but then we made contact. Chris was setting up but we kept going and when I checked later I’d missed him.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-18.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-18.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-19.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-6"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-19.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>The bridge across the river wasn’t much better, probably made worse by the fact cold air can get under as well as above it, but we made it over okay. We met some coos at the remote Wester Gaulrig Cottage, and at this point had probably been going for about 50 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-20.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-7"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-20.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>We were past half way but still plenty to go, and now the steeper parts of the route were upon us. We could see the summit in the distance, and partially doubted that it was correct as “it seemed so far away”. We were correct, it was the summit!</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-13.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-8"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-13.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I dumped my bike at the base of the final ascent, but my friend Mike, on his ebike, gave it a shot to get to the top. The snow had drifted much more here and snow pattern told tales of strong winds. The cloud was coming in now and the good views across to Ben Avon and surroundings had gone, with only huge clouds looming over the distant high summits.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-16.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-9"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-16.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>We made it at 12:30, 1.5 hours after leaving Tomintoul, and much later than my alert. Fraser and Chris were just back at their landys for my first two QSOs on Cnap Chaochan Aitinn. I called a few more times on 2m but didn’t have any luck. I wasn’t that patient with it though and chose not to setup the slim g but just go straight to 40m … I’d come all this way, I couldn’t leave without the 40 on 40 on 40! The wind was brutal and oh so cold. We did have some equipment that we could hide behind, and took some shelter there whilst I tried to setup on 40m.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-5.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-10"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-5.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-6.jpg" class="img-fluid">I’m sure I could’ve used the small towers there to my benefit, but I was also wary of the wind turbine and getting wire caught in it, so I setup my mast down wind of it, trying to keep it close enough so I could operate from the shelter. Typically, as soon as I spotted and called CQ once the mast moved, then fell. It was tricky finding ground to get the pegs in for the guys…so I recruited another guy to hold the mast whilst he ate his super noodles!</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-12.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-11"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-12.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-15.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-12"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-15.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I managed 6 on 40m, including a very nice summit to summit with Colin, M1BUU, as above, before I had to call QRT on the pile up. It was just too cold in the wind, even in the “shelter”. Quickly packed up and whilst admiring the views I realised the wind turbine noise had stopped and there was, in fact, no wind whatsoever! I got the HT back out and messaged Dave, MM7HMA, a local who’s just past his test and was keen to get some QSOs, and we had a nice chat. The stillness didn’t last and the return of the wind reminded us it was time to head back.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-3.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-13"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>

<p>Back to the bike - still there 😅- and back to the car. It’s mostly downhill, but still a few steep climbs as the path goes up and down. The temperature had come up a little, and a fair amount of ice had melted so the journey was less hazardous. I was back home in plenty of time.</p>
<p><a href="cnap-chaochan-9.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-16"><img src="https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2024/gm-es-040/cnap-chaochan-9.jpg" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>Not quite the S2S action hoped for, but still a successful trip and good day out! 🎂Plus one more complete for Fraser 😅</p>
<p>I think no-one comes here as there are other summits in the area you’d do first, but the fact you can cycle right to the top does make it quite a unique one, plus with plenty of refreshment options in Tomintoul for afterwards!</p>

<p>Off to the park on the patch of dirt outside the gate into the forest and then up the track. Again, an easy route to follow although the climb up to the summit along the wall, whilst sheltered, is just heather and quite steep in places. Another summit benefitting from a nice wall to shelter behind, I setup again on HF and this time tried 20m.</p>

<p>I had a big pile up on 20m, and whilst I wanted to be packing up at 3pm, I kept saying “QRZ?”! It did eventually die down about 10 past, and I packed up and headed down. The setting sun cast a strange light over the land - my phone camera doesn’t do it justice.</p>
