    "text": "It‚Äôs both a blessing and a curse that amateur radio has so many different facets and parts‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt even begin to list them all: antennas, operating frequencies, circuitry, radios, modes of operation, amplifiers, structures, networks, digital, analog, moon bounce, competitions, prizes, collecting, ‚Ä¶ and even each of those sections has subsections or intersections of sections üòÖ It truly is a hobby for life.\n\n\n\nBetter start young then\n\n\nThis isn‚Äôt meant to sound like complaining, more of an expression of overwhelming amazement. The hardest thing for me is to work out what I want to do. I love reading, talking, listening and watching about what others are doing, and every time I do I learn about another facet that sounds really interesting and something I want to do. The fear I have is that I spend forever looking at what I could do but yet never actually do anything for myself! I have to remind myself that I don‚Äôt need to do everything immediately. I‚Äôve only had a licence since January this year, and I‚Äôve only been on the air for five months!\nI also get daily reminders of how little free time I actually have. I work full time and we have four children ‚â§ 10 years old. I only really have time for one thing each evening ‚Äì which includes writing blog posts! ‚Äì and so I‚Äôm going to use my favourite outliner app, Dynalist, to make a list of all the things I want to do, in order to pick and choose what I should do now and next. It also serves as a place to put useful things I find related to it, although that‚Äôs too organised for me and I‚Äôm more likely to put stuff in my wiki. Actually, I‚Äôm more likely to read something and think I should make a note of it but don‚Äôt. Anyway, it helps focus and stops me spending forever looking at stuff.\nRight now, my tasks are to finish the QO-100 setup, design the garage workshop layout and get it built including the relocation of the shack. But sometimes I‚Äôm tired after work and the kids, and just want to sit on the radio and see who‚Äôs out there.\nWhich leaves me with the thought that even if I built or changed nothing ever again, there are always different people out there to speak to, different propagation patterns and the enjoyment of talking to someone else who also enjoys this hobby.\n\n\n\nI should also finish my other projects I started before getting my licence!"

    "text": "Feed point of random wire with 9:1 unun\n\n\nFor some reason, I tend to avoid trying out 15 meters, but yesterday I decided to give it a shot, and it went quite well. I began by experimenting with my 39.5-meter random wire antenna in the garden. It has excellent reception, and I could hear approximately 20 Japanese stations. However, when it came to transmitting, it didn‚Äôt perform as well as expected. I thought that the higher frequency of 15 meters might compensate for its low height, but according to pskreporter, it seemed that no one was receiving my signals. While I believe I managed to make a few QSOs, I eventually wanted to move indoors. The random wire is just a temporary setup, and I have to sit outside to use it.\n\n\n\nFar field plot at 15m on my random wire\n\n\nI switched back to using my EFHW (End-Fed Half-Wave) antenna, which still provided good reception. Being positioned at about 8 meters in height, it was much more effective for transmitting. My radio is currently set up in the kitchen, and I sit on the floor with a beanbag while operating it. I‚Äôm currently (or at least I like to think I am) in the process of designing a new workbench or shack in the garage. I‚Äôve also been contemplating the idea of remote operation. I wanted to continue designing my garage setup, but at the same time, I was making numerous FT8 contacts with desirable DX countries. Given that I‚Äôm using a Windows laptop with the radio, an obvious solution is the Remote Desktop Connection application. I‚Äôm not sure why I didn‚Äôt try it earlier. The only thing I needed to check was the audio settings, as the default settings would route the remote computer‚Äôs audio to me, causing WSJT-X to lose access to the soundcard. However, it‚Äôs a simple fix in the options to prevent this.\n\n\n\nAudio on remote computer\n\n\nWith that sorted out, WSJT-X and Grid Tracker could occupy one screen while I worked on the other comfortably from my desk. WSJT-X doesn‚Äôt have all the CAT commands required, so if I needed to adjust more settings on the radio, I‚Äôd have to use another program. I‚Äôm also unsure if CAT can control everything on the FT-DX10, such as the preset option I use for digital modes. For the time being, that‚Äôs acceptable since it‚Äôs just across the house.\nLast night, 15 meters, with occasional forays into 17 meters, turned out to be quite successful for me. There were instances of signal fading, and sometimes it took a while to receive a ‚ÄúRR73‚Äù reply from the other station, so whether or not everyone will log the QSOs depends on their perspective. Nonetheless, from my standpoint, we successfully exchanged signal reports.\n\n\n\nMap of world with spots showing QSOs\n\n\nI also found pskreporter not very reliable, as it would often show only two stations hearing me when I‚Äôd then get multiple replies to my CQ."

    "text": "Shortly after getting on the air with my Xiegu G90, I became intrigued by FT8. After some initial experimentation, I managed to set it up and began making QSOs. Initially, I was thrilled to hear stations from all over the world ‚Äì Australia, Japan, South America, and various other places. At first, I believed I could establish contact with all of them. However, after numerous attempts to connect with different stations, I discovered pskreporter. This tool allowed me to determine who could hear me. While it was disappointing to realize that hearing a station didn‚Äôt guarantee they could hear me, seeing the immediate feedback on pskreporter was just as enjoyable as making an actual contact, especially on days when distant countries could receive my signals.\nThe information provided by pskreporter makes FT8 interesting, especially when testing new antennas or different power levels. However, excessive usage of it can become somewhat monotonous. It‚Äôs convenient when used alongside other activities, but sitting in front of it for prolonged periods without any other engagement is not advisable. Depending on your antenna setup, you may find that you‚Äôre only able to reach specific parts of the world, making it nearly impossible to make new connections. While I occasionally manage to contact a few new countries with my horizontal EFHW antenna, it‚Äôs not as effective as a vertical, such as this one described by M0AWS.\nI found the user interface of WSJT-X somewhat lacking and soon discovered GridTracker. As it says on the website ‚ÄúGridTracker listens to traffic from WSJT-X and displays it on a map‚Äú. While it offers more functionality, that‚Äôs the core idea. I use its call roster to identify who‚Äôs calling or communicating, making my contacts based on that information. Only recently did I delve into the manual on the website and decide to pursue grid square chasing.\nA conversation in the Ham radio matrix chat about gamifying FT8 caught my attention. This intrigued me, as it seemed like a way to inject more interest into FT8. The most apparent approach was to start collecting grid squares from different countries. Now, I had a reason to contact those Italian and German stations. GridTracker proved to be highly useful for this purpose."

    "text": "Useful GridTracker Settings\nI encourage you to read the full manual, it‚Äôs not that long and you‚Äôll then understand the whole software much better. Here are the settings I‚Äôve discovered that simplify the process of collecting grid squares using the software.\n\nCall Roster\n\n\n\nTable of contacts\n\n\nI hardly ever use the map view in GridTracker. While it does display pskreport spots along with grids, the map can become cluttered, making it challenging to discern the information. I might briefly glance at the spot heatmap or switch to pskreporter for my spotters. My primary focus is on the call roster. This window is positioned next to WSJT-X‚Äôs main window and waterfall display. The call roster streamlines the substantial amount of information from WSJT-X into a concise, organized format. It allows for various filters, but I generally keep the filters quite open, toggling between all activity and CQ calls only.\nThe standout feature is the color coding of cells. A black background signifies a confirmed contact, a black-blue gradient indicates an unconfirmed contact, and a blue background represents a new grid. This arrangement allows me to quickly identify areas I still need to reach. With the CQ Only filter activated, it becomes easy to determine whom to respond to. Another setting I find useful is marking RR73 as a CQ. This way, I can spot stations just finishing up their last QSO, and I might have a chance to catch them as they start calling CQ.\nTo open the call roster, click on the Clipboard/Medal button in the menu. üìãü•á\n\n\nMap View\nAlthough I seldom use the map view, it serves as a useful tool to track your progress with grids. The heatmap of spots can also provide valuable insights. Ensure that you have the bands set to ‚ÄúMixed‚Äù rather than the default ‚ÄúAuto.‚Äù The Auto setting uses the band you‚Äôre currently on, which limts what you see, and unless your trying to get all the grids by band you probably want Mixed. Mixed displays all bands.\n\n\n\nMixed shows all bands\n\n\n\n\nLog data\nGrid Tracker is only useful if it knows all your logs. By default it‚Äôll read the wsjt-x log file on your computer but that won‚Äôt always have everything, and if you want to include voice or other modes that won‚Äôt help. The way I‚Äôve found to work best is to use its ability to import log data from elsewhere. There are a few options and you can set them in the Logging page of the settings.\n\n\n\nAll the logs\n\n\nGrid Tracker can pull and push log data. The Startup? and Menu? settings show the options for pulling log data, with startup meaning it queries it when you open Grid Tracker, and Menu meaning it adds a button to the menu for you to trigger a download. As you can see above the options are local files, psk-reporter, qrz, clublog and LoTW. I decided to go with LoTW as that seems to be the most commonly used central logging database. This means that wherever I capture my QSOs, as long as they get into LoTW, Grid Tracker will know about them. I could just add all of the others too.\nFor longer operating sessions with numerous QSOs, clicking the LoTW button in the menu will pull in confirmations. GridTracker maintains its own log, providing a record of your contacts.\nI also use GridTracker to send my WSJT-X logs to Cloudlog, my primary logbook. This process subsequently uploads all my logs to platforms like LoTW, Clublog, and eQSL. As indicated in the Log? column, GridTracker interfaces with various popular logging tools.\nIn essence, GridTracker‚Äôs configuration is straightforward and quick, enhancing the appeal of WSJT-X data and simplifying the tracking of contacts."

    "text": "Appreciating FT8\nWhile I‚Äôve been licensed for a relatively short time, I‚Äôve encountered strong opinions about FT8, including some negative viewpoints. I don‚Äôt enjoy coffee, but I wouldn‚Äôt tell coffee enthusiasts that they‚Äôre consuming it incorrectly. I won‚Äôt speculate on the reasons people dislike FT8, but instead, I‚Äôll share some observations that might not be immediately apparent.\nThese days, it‚Äôs common for unique locations to incorporate FT8 into their setups. Therefore, if you‚Äôre aiming to access new DX locations, FT8 offers a viable method. I also appreciate that it levels the playing field to some extent, unlike SSB or even CW. How often have I heard a VK or JA station (not rare DX, just less common), only to be faced with an overwhelming pileup as European countries with 2 kW power outputs drown out smaller stations like mine, operating at 100 W? Breaking through is nearly impossible. While CW might provide slightly better odds due to fewer operators compared to SSB, plus the reduced SNR needed to work someone, the challenge for QRP stations remains. With FT8, if your signal reaches them with 10W or 50W, your presence is acknowledged, significantly improving your chances. While there may be techniques for gaining an edge when working a pileup station on FT8, such as adjusting transmit settings or clock settings, the gap is much smaller. Skill is required here as well.\nWhen engaging with a popular station on SSB or CW, conversations are often minimal. Regular HF QSOs frequently consist of a brief exchange involving callsigns, RST, and possibly a name or location. This is not drastically different from an FT8 QSO. If your goal is to accumulate numerous contacts, reach various locations, or connect with rare stations, FT8 offers similar dynamics. If you seek in-depth discussions, FT8 isn‚Äôt the appropriate choice; it‚Äôs not a direct comparison. For that purpose, you might explore JS8Call.\nIn closing, while I risk getting sidetracked into an argument, I emphasize that the beauty of amateur radio as a hobby is rooted in personal enjoyment. If you find it enjoyable, that‚Äôs fantastic! If not, then there‚Äôs no obligation to pursue it; everyone‚Äôs preferences differ.\n\n\n\nGotta catch em all! üê≤üî¥üéÆüìª\n\n\nNow, back to the quilt! I initially thought the UK would be an easy starting point!"

    "title": "QO-100 Build: Part 1 ‚Äì The Design",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I think I first heard about QO-100 when looking at a local amateur‚Äôs QRZ page. He‚Äôd setup a couple of satellite dishes in his garden and had his QO-100 DX Club logo on his profile page, along with some other links. That started me down the rabbit hole. üêáüõ∞Ô∏è\nBriefly, and there‚Äôs more details here, QO-100 is the name given to a geostationary satellite that sits above Africa and has amateur radio transponders. This means it‚Äôs always in the same place, and can be used by amateur radio license holders to make contacts across its coverage. Being in such a high orbit means it has a huge area of coverage, so you can contact anyone in this area and talk to them for hours without the worry of propagation changing and losing contact.\nAnother thing that makes this interesting is that it has both narrow and wide bands. This allows for voice, Morse and simpler digital modes on the narrowband and then on the wide band amateur television! So people can broadcast video via the satellite, there‚Äôs even a weekly net by the British Amateur Television Club (BATC), and they sometimes save them to YouTube. Doing video broadcasting requires a lot more equipment and power, and is maybe a step too far for me.\nThe satellite has been in orbit for about 5 years, so there are a lot of tutorials and guides online on how to get setup, together with people making items that help get connected. The main ones I found useful where DK1MI‚Äôs, M0AWS‚Äôs, and G7IYK‚Äôs Instructables page. My setup is basically the same as DK1MI and G7IYK‚Äôs, which I‚Äôll explain shortly.\nThere seems to be two approaches to getting on the air with QO-100, one is via a SDR that can transmit as well as receive and the other is a transverter that takes you transmitter‚Äôs 2m or 70cm output and ups it to the send frequency. This means you can use a real radio to transmit. You can then either use a SDR for receive or use a downconverter and have your radio be the Rx as well. As I don‚Äôt have a 2m/70cm radio, and the location of my dish is not conducive to using a radio, I went with the SDR option, as that means everything can be housed in a box underneath the dish and all I have to run to it is power and ethernet.\nLike most satellites the uplink and the downlink are on different frequencies, in this case it‚Äôs an uplink of 2.4 GHz (think wifi) and downlink is 10 GHz. The downlink is fairly easy, as a LNB (think Sky dish) can receive it and converts it down to 700 MHz range. This is perfectly fine for most SDR receivers to use. Uplink generally requires some amplification as either the upconverter or the SDR only outputs at very low power‚Ä¶but now we‚Äôre getting too into the detail."

    "title": "QO-100 Build: Part 1 ‚Äì The Design",
    "section": "My Plans",
    "text": "My Plans\nMy in a loose sense of the word as it‚Äôs pretty much copying what many others have already done and figured out. I just found it useful to layout so that I could make sure I had all the right parts, particularly on the power side. I also attempted to figure out the power on the transmit side. Original version here.\n\n\n\nMy QO-100 Schematic\n\n\n\nThe Receive\nYou‚Äôll want a dish. I mooned over a 1.2m dish for a long time, but the price and size meant it was a no go for me. 80 cm seemed a common size for narrowband, and wideband probably wants something bigger than 1.2 anyway. I measured up where I was planning on putting it and 1.2m was probably too big, maybe I could of squeezed in a 1m but 80 cm should be good enough.\nWhen thinking about what dish size, it‚Äôs important to think about the location of it. The satellite is to the south from the UK, near enough the same direction as sky dishes ‚Äì a good guide if you or neighbours have on. You can get dish pointing info from the BATC on their website. So you can drag a pin around to place it exactly where you want it.\nI originally wanted it on a south westerly wall but it probably would‚Äôve ended up being mounted at 90¬∞ and that would mean being at least 40cm off the wall ‚Äì perfect for a gust of wind to rip it off! However, I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a south-ish facing wall at the back of my house and so it was okay to find another location. I also bought a U shaped mount, so it could sit flush to the wall, which helps with wind loading and keeping it out the way.\nThe signal is focused onto a LNB (low-noise block downconverter). According to the internet, the Bullseye LNB is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù one. It‚Äôs fairly cheap, ~¬£30, and stable. In order for it to recieve the signal, a voltage has to be applied for polarisation of the signal. In our case, for the narrowband we need it to be vertically polarised and so applying 12V is what‚Äôs needed. This is done with a handy biased tee, that allows you to inject the voltage to the feed from the LNB, but blocks the DC voltage from continuing on to your recevier. I used satellite cable, the typical f type connector, 75 ohm stuff.\nThat‚Äôs it! The signal then continues to your SDR, in my case the Pluto+ SDR. A cheap SDR like a RTL-SDR or NooElec will do the job. As I said, a(nother) downconverter is an option but not the route I took.\n\n\nPluto+ SDR\nNow‚Äôs a good time to talk about this SDR. First came the Adalm-Pluto by Analog devices. A great SDR which has transmit and recieve and ideal for students and amateurs alike. Many people use this SDR with great success and many have modified it themselves to improve it.\nThe Pluto+ is an upgraded version of Analog device‚Äôs SDR with various improvements available out of the box. Most noticeable are the metal enclosure, the four SMA connections, for two sets of recevie and transmit, a gigabit ethernet connection, a microSD slot, a external clock input on the PCB, and 0.5 ppm TCXO. Probably there are other tweaks too but not things that stood out to me. To me the biggest selling point was the network port and the relative ease at which you can add a GPSDO for stability (not something I had as part of the original plan but a nice blog post from DK1MI again shows how easy it is to add).\nIn my hours of searching and reading forums I recall coming across something like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre building on from scratch go for the Pluto+‚Äù, and so I did. I bought mine from Aliexpress.\nTech Minds has a nice video on it if you want to see more.\n\n\nThe Transmit\nThe Pluto+ SDR has a transmit and can output 2.4 GHz in the region of up to 4 mW, which is great but also not going to get you a contact, and so some amplification is needed. These days it‚Äôs pretty much a standard design to use the Analog Devices CN-0417 amplifier straight out of the SDR and then another one to take it to up to 20 W. It seems like you really only need 10 W with a 80 cm dish to get a strong signal. In fact, if you transmit with too much power you hear a two-tone siren going off called LEILA warning you to turn down. A popular amp is the SG Labs 20W model from Bulgaria, and so that‚Äôs what I picked. 20W seems useful to overcome and losses in connectors and cables.\nWhich brings to me to cables. At 2.4 GHz, losses are high on regular coax (RG58/213) and so you really want some fancier stuff. I went for LMR-400-UF (UF for ultra-flexible to get round corners). It has many layers and is quite something to hold after only ever using RG58 on HF. You also want to keep it as short as possible and so the amplifier needs to be near your dish.\nFinally, the actual feed to the dish. There seems to be two or three styles people use, a ‚ÄúPOTY‚Äù or a helix seem most common. I felt like there were a lot of pieces to this build and so I wasn‚Äôt wanting to build everything myself, I decided to buy an Ice Cone feed from nolle engineering in Germany. This is a helix design, housed in a 3D printed case that looks like a huge ice cream cone. It‚Äôs designed very well and sits on top of the LNB (they even sell adapters for the most common LNBs people use with QO-100).\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a three scoop minimum.\n\n\n\n\nPower\nAll these bits and bobs need power, and at different voltages:\n\nThe biased tee needs 12 V\nThe Pluto+ SDR and CN-0417 need 5 V\nSG Labs PA needs 24-28 V\n\nAgain, as a common build, people have found a common solution, particularly as a lot of people power it from their shack power supply, and everything hangs off a 12 V supply. There are two DC converters, one to 5V with USB sockets for those users and then one that converts to 28V (although is adjustable) from 12V.\nFor me, and the location of my shack and the dish meant I needed an external power supply. Luckily, I have an external power socket within 5m or so of the dish so I just needed to convert it to 12V. In the end I decided upon a Meanwell power brick ‚Äì think laptop brick ‚Äì which gives up to 5A on 12V, this should be more than enough. I also bought a great long kettle lead to plug it in. Going for the brick meant it could sit in my waterproof enclosure with everything else. Plus the 5V DC converter had a pin socket, so I could use the pin from the power supply to power it and then the input pins, which are in parallel, for transferring that 12V on to the other users.\nFor the enclosure I found this on screwfix. It‚Äôs just about big enough. The mounting isn‚Äôt great but works.\n\n\nCost\nIt‚Äôs quite pricey to do this build. Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to list it all here and add it up üòÖ However, as I didn‚Äôt have a 70cm/2m radio this route was probably going to be the cheapest. I could‚Äôve scounged more on items, or tried to find more things used, but insted I bought the parts over about 6 weeks, then when it was only one ¬£100-150 thing a week it didn‚Äôt feel that bad! Ballpark is probably ¬£600-700. I also ended up buying some tools and general items that I didn‚Äôt have, but will be useful for other projects.\n\n\nand finally‚Ä¶\nHave I built it yet? I have, (and maybe why I struggle with tense in this post!) it still has a couple of issues but I‚Äôve made some QSOs. More details in the next part.\n\n\n\nInpromptu dish mounting"

With a few days planned to stay near Aviemore in the summer holidays I thought it was the perfect time to try it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA converted church was our accommodation for the trip. Very fancy!\n\n\nI have a 6m telescopic pole and decided to make a vertical antenna with it. In an effort to keep it simple, I went for a 1/4 wave for 20m with some radials and a 1:1 choke wrapping the coax around a torroid.\nI‚Äôd left making the antenna until the night before we were due to go and so it was a bit of a rush to make it! I cut the wire considerably longer as I didn‚Äôt want to try and be too smart on my first attempt, and would use the NanoVNA to cut it to the right length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat too long!\n\n\nI think this worked against me as I ended up cutting it many times and then got sloppy and rushed, which meant I went from a 1.1 SWR at 14.035 MHz to 1.07 at 14.385 MHz..oops! By this time it was 9pm and I was meant to be packing other things. So I took the bit of wire I cut off and figured I‚Äôd reattach it later. I had also cut 5x 5m ish radials, and was using a dipole connector I had for the coax to wire connections.\nWe were staying with friends who were interested in hearing about amateur radio and why I was doing it, particularly when I set everything up outside. I tried not to blah on too much‚Ä¶\nOur house backed onto the forest and there was no boundary between the garden ending and the forest starting, so I just setup near the bench and had the antenna towards the trees and out the way of running kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup at the holiday house\n\n\nAs well as my first time portable, it was my first time with a vertical and I was interested in how it performed compared to my horizontal EFHW I have at home. This is where I really like FT8 and pskreporter. Regardless of QSOs I make, I can see who hears me and I can obviously see who I hear.\nI immediately noticed how many ZL stations I could hear, far more than I‚Äôve ever had before. I think at home I‚Äôve maybe seen one very briefly, but now I was seeing 5-8 stations for several hours in the morning. In fact I saw countries from all over the world that I‚Äôve rarely heard before, it was like a deluxe buffet of locations!\nMy hastily cut and then reattached wire wasn‚Äôt the greatest, the G90 could tune it on 20m and several other bands but I kept it on 20m as I didn‚Äôt have that long to play in the radio and this should be the least worst band for it! Nevertheless, it worked and I was heard all around the world.\n\n\n\nWho‚Äôs listening?\n\n\nI made about 17 contacts that day, in the morning and then a little in the afternoon. A variety of European countries, including a couple of portable stations in Slovenia and Belgium, and also a contact in Oklahoma state. I listened in on SSB but didn‚Äôt get round to making any contacts on voice.\nAll in all, I was pleased with my first go, plenty of things to improve on next time and maybe try a different vertical, perhaps an end fed or just a better job cutting it! I do also want to get a bigger pole to move up to half wave territory. I‚Äôm not hiking up mountains so weight isn‚Äôt a huge factor, and I‚Äôm thinking of taking it down to the sea one time and seeing if the salt water helps me reach the exotic locations!\n\n\n\nTesting in the garden"

    "text": "I spent a while debating if I really wanted to build this. I knew the build would be fun, but would it be fun using it? I also knew it wasn‚Äôt cheap, and would I regret it once I was done? After a few weeks of thinking this whilst researching the build, I ended up ordering the helix ice cone antenna late one June night. There was no going back now.\nOver the course of a couple a weeks I ordered all the parts, buying a few each day made it feel like I wasn‚Äôt spending too much!\nThere were also a bunch of bits and pieces I ended up buying as I didn‚Äôt have them. Like drill bits for making holes, screws, zip ties, small files, wire, etc. which I needed for this project but will be useful for other things. So accounting for some sundries, the total cost is about ¬£800.\nTo cut some costs, you could definitely get a cheaper dish and mount, there are plenty on eBay for less or you might be lucky and find something lying around. You might want to try an old sky dish too. The helix antenna is maybe another area to cut costs, either by building it yourself (if you have a 3D printer) or maybe getting a POTY. I didn‚Äôt look into the POTY, don‚Äôt have a 3D printer and mostly wanted something that I knew would just work. I could‚Äôve tried cheaper cable for 2.4 GHz as well.\nIf you already have a VHF/UHF radio, then an upconverter, like the one from DX Patrol, will save you some money vs.¬†going with the Pluto+SDR, although you will probably need to get an SDR receiver as well. The DX Patrol power amplifier is more expensive, but gives you pins for SWR etc. wheres the SG Labs doesn‚Äôt.\nSG Labs ordering process is a reassuring one üòÖ. You email them, they let you know the price, you send them money on paypal and then you wait a few weeks for the shipping confirmation. Lead time was about 3 weeks for me."

    "text": "Assembly\nFor the most part, it‚Äôs not tricky to build. There‚Äôs almost no soldering and it‚Äôs just joining things together once you‚Äôve figured out the layout in the box and how you‚Äôre getting power and network to it. Depending on you situation this will be a breeze or a massive pain in the neck! I think my situation was somewhere in betewen, not easy but not impossible. Here are some photos of my build underway.\n\n\n\nUnpacking the dish\n\n\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a big ice cream\n\n\n\n\n\n1st receive testing\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the voltage\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy connectors\n\n\n\n\n\nOops!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team of expert dish aligners\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking alignment\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting the helix\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking some more holes\n\n\n\n\n\nBox of tricks\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting transmit\n\n\n\n\n\nWeatherproofing\n\n\nThe hardest parts for me was making up the fancy fittings on the LMR400 coax. There was a N type and a SMA fitting and they both had several parts and soldering of the pin. I fell foul to the usual thing of forgetting a bit and cutting off slightly too much. I also didn‚Äôt have a pair of wire cutters that could get through the coax ‚Äì it‚Äôs so thick! However, after making the ends up, I really like the cable, and going back to RG58 is like using thread after holding some rope!\nMy dish is located on a fake balcony, so it‚Äôs out the way but also not very accessible. I have to get the ladders out each time or climb out a bedroom window, this usually put me off doing much on an evening as I couldn‚Äôt be bothered with the ladders, and one of kids was sleeping in said bedroom! Overall I was very slow at putting it all together, but if you could dedicate a day to it, then you‚Äôd finish it in one go.\nAt my QTH, the dish elevation has to be at 20.5 degrees. I found this to be the absolute lower limit for my dish, whereby the scale starts at 20 degrees, and I think for an 80 cm dish it only goes to 22 degrees. However, I receive signals well so that‚Äôs good enough. If you‚Äôre any further north you‚Äôll have to get a non-standard mount, or possibly try installing it upside down, with the arm and LNB at the top. (This is for an offset dish)."

    "text": "Setting up the Pluto SDR\nBefore you pack the Pluto+ into the box, you‚Äôll want to setup the networking on it and verify it works. It‚Äôs quite straight forward. You plug it into your computer‚Äôs USB via the data socket and it‚Äôll show up as a drive. You want to edit the config.txt file, and find the section called USB Ethernet.\n[USB_ETHERNET]\nipaddr_eth = 192.168.1.200\nnetmask_eth = 255.255.255.0\nSet the IP to something for your network, ideally outside your router‚Äôs DHCP range. If you can‚Äôt do that, then give it an IP then set a reserved IP on your router for the Pluto+. I had to manually add a MAC address to the reserved IP, and now the router won‚Äôt give out .200 to anything else. Make sure you eject it/unmount it properly before disconnecting. You can then plug it into the network and see if you can ssh into it. The default username is root and password analog, and you should log in just fine.\nYou might also want to upgrade the firmware whilst you‚Äôre at it. DK1MI has a nice post on how to do that.\nI found the Pluto+ would make a new SSH key each time it booted up, and so SSH would complain that it didn‚Äôt match from last time (known_hosts) and prevent me from logging in. I avoided this with this entry in my ssh/config file:\nHost pluto\n  HostName 192.168.1.200\n  User root\n  StrictHostKeyChecking no\n  UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\nNow I can just type ssh pluto and it greets me with the logon prompt. &lt;security warnings etc.&gt;"

    "text": "Networking\nThe Pluto+‚Äôs built in gigabit network port is very convenient. Connecting it to my network in its place under the dish wasn‚Äôt. My temporary solution was to run a cable out the bedroom window. This is fine as a temporary setup, and even okay overnight during the summer. However, it was not a long term solution. I am fortunate that my house was built with network ports in all rooms, but the room underneath the dish has network ports that are nowhere near the right side of the house for the dish. I also had the problem of getting it out of the house, as I‚Äôd rather not drill holes though the walls if I can help it.\nOur garage has the heating boiler in it, and so has several large air vents. These just have grills over them on the inside and outside of the house and so I decided one of these would be the perfect conduit for network cable to get out of the house. However, there are no network drops in the garage, and it‚Äôs a good 20-25 m along two walls of the house to get from the vent to the dish. I was wanting a network connection in the garage, as it‚Äôs where I plan on having a workbench/shack setup at some stage, and running cables isn‚Äôt exactly the hardest DIY one can do! A big drill bit, and a long spool of cable and away I went.\n\n\n\nSerious problems need serious solutions\n\n\nThe office backs onto the garage, and makes a good place to connect into the network. I ended up getting three drill bits as the first wasn‚Äôt long enough, the second was for masonary and I hit wood, and then finally the 40cm wood bit went the whole way through! For a while I was worried I‚Äôd hit a water waste pipe, or worse, soil pipe, as the bathroom is above me, but it turned out to be a wooden stud. I tried running the wire along the wall outside, but it looked messy. Being dark blue against a light finish didn‚Äôt help, and so then I buried it in the gravel instead.\n\n\n\nRoute to the outside\n\n\n\n\n\nUgly\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy\n\n\nThe only problem with the network cable is that the plug is made up inside the box, and so I can‚Äôt remove the box from its location. The coax is made up inside but I can disconnect the other end from the dish and just carry it with the box. The network cable is not quite as easy, given it‚Äôs 30m back to the network port. I left lots of excess, so if I really do have to move it, I can just cut off the plug and pull it out of the grommet.\nI did think I could make an outdoor network switch, and have jumper cables between the boxes, and this would enable me to setup something else outdoors. Like raspberry pis, or other SDRs. I‚Äôd need a power setup but that would be fairly straightforward as there‚Äôs an external plug socket nearby. That‚Äôs a project for another day.\nNext up will be the software!\n\n\n\nSDR Console"
