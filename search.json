    "text": "My first radio was the Xiegu G90, and when I bought my Yaesu FT-DX10 I decided I‚Äôd keep the G90 for portable operations. It‚Äôs pretty small, 20W, and I already have it and know how it works. With a few days planned to stay near Aviemore in the summer holidays I thought it was the perfect time to try it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA converted church was our accommodation for the trip. Very fancy!\n\n\nI have a 6m telescopic pole and decided to make a vertical antenna with it. In an effort to keep it simple, I went for a 1/4 wave for 20m with some radials and a 1:1 choke wrapping the coax around a torroid.\nI‚Äôd left making the antenna until the night before we were due to go and so it was a bit of a rush to make it! I cut the wire considerably longer as I didn‚Äôt want to try and be too smart on my first attempt, and would use the NanoVNA to cut it to the right length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat too long!\n\n\nI think this worked against me as I ended up cutting it many times and then got sloppy and rushed, which meant I went from a 1.1 SWR at 14.035 MHz to 1.07 at 14.385 MHz..oops! By this time it was 9pm and I was meant to be packing other things. So I took the bit of wire I cut off and figured I‚Äôd reattach it later. I had also cut 5x 5m ish radials, and was using a dipole connector I had for the coax to wire connections.\nWe were staying with friends who were interested in hearing about amateur radio and why I was doing it, particularly when I set everything up outside. I tried not to blah on too much‚Ä¶\nOur house backed onto the forest and there was no boundary between the garden ending and the forest starting, so I just setup near the bench and had the antenna towards the trees and out the way of running kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup at the holiday house\n\n\nAs well as my first time portable, it was my first time with a vertical and I was interested in how it performed compared to my horizontal EFHW I have at home. This is where I really like FT8 and pskreporter. Regardless of QSOs I make, I can see who hears me and I can obviously see who I hear.\nI immediately noticed how many ZL stations I could hear, far more than I‚Äôve ever had before. I think at home I‚Äôve maybe seen one very briefly, but now I was seeing 5-8 stations for several hours in the morning. In fact I saw countries from all over the world that I‚Äôve rarely heard before, it was like a deluxe buffet of locations!\nMy hastily cut and then reattached wire wasn‚Äôt the greatest, the G90 could tune it on 20m and several other bands but I kept it on 20m as I didn‚Äôt have that long to play in the radio and this should be the least worst band for it! Nevertheless, it worked and I was heard all around the world.\n\n\n\nWho‚Äôs listening?\n\n\nI made about 17 contacts that day, in the morning and then a little in the afternoon. A variety of European countries, including a couple of portable stations in Slovenia and Belgium, and also a contact in Oklahoma state. I listened in on SSB but didn‚Äôt get round to making any contacts on voice.\nAll in all, I was pleased with my first go, plenty of things to improve on next time and maybe try a different vertical, perhaps an end fed or just a better job cutting it! I do also want to get a bigger pole to move up to half wave territory. I‚Äôm not hiking up mountains so weight isn‚Äôt a huge factor, and I‚Äôm thinking of taking it down to the sea one time and seeing if the salt water helps me reach the exotic locations!\n\n\n\nTesting in the garden"

    "text": "For a little while, the Matrix Radio group have been talking about a HF net at some stage. I think I offered to do something, but have yet to do so! Steve, M0XVT, raised that he joins a 60m net and we all thought that sounded like a good idea to try. We‚Äôd agreed to join at 9pm on 5.3985 MHz. This would be my first attempts on the 60 m / 5 MHz band.\nMy HF antenna is a EFHW for 40m, and it‚Äôs not naturally resonant on 60m, but I suspected my Xiegu G90 would be able to tune it up as it‚Äôs pretty decent at matching anything to anything!\n\n\n\nBand plan summary from RSGB\n\n\nMy only experience with the 5 MHz band is from my full licence exam. The UK band plan is probably the most complex band plan there is for amateur radio. It makes it ideal for writing exam questions! The amount of warnings about transmitting outside the band plan due to the other user of the frequecy, aka the military, does make for careful planning. The RSGB page has lots of info on it, but it‚Äôs not the sort of thing you just quickly tune to and call CQ or even respond to others.\nThe 60m net, 5.3985 MHz, is on Sunday mornings at 0700 UTC, but I‚Äôve not joined in as I‚Äôm still between shacks.\nI also learnt of the trick of using a WebSDR to listen to a net you‚Äôre in. Sometimes they can hear you but not vice-versa, and so at least this helps with the flow of the net. You can get some software to sync your SDR and rig (or write your own with NodeRed) but for a net, when you‚Äôre not moving about, manually setting is good enough."

    "text": "I spent a while debating if I really wanted to build this. I knew the build would be fun, but would it be fun using it? I also knew it wasn‚Äôt cheap, and would I regret it once I was done? After a few weeks of thinking this whilst researching the build, I ended up ordering the helix ice cone antenna late one June night. There was no going back now.\nOver the course of a couple a weeks I ordered all the parts, buying a few each day made it feel like I wasn‚Äôt spending too much!\nThere were also a bunch of bits and pieces I ended up buying as I didn‚Äôt have them. Like drill bits for making holes, screws, zip ties, small files, wire, etc. which I needed for this project but will be useful for other things. So accounting for some sundries, the total cost is about ¬£800.\nTo cut some costs, you could definitely get a cheaper dish and mount, there are plenty on eBay for less or you might be lucky and find something lying around. You might want to try an old sky dish too. The helix antenna is maybe another area to cut costs, either by building it yourself (if you have a 3D printer) or maybe getting a POTY. I didn‚Äôt look into the POTY, don‚Äôt have a 3D printer and mostly wanted something that I knew would just work. I could‚Äôve tried cheaper cable for 2.4 GHz as well.\nIf you already have a VHF/UHF radio, then an upconverter, like the one from DX Patrol, will save you some money vs.¬†going with the Pluto+SDR, although you will probably need to get an SDR receiver as well. The DX Patrol power amplifier is more expensive, but gives you pins for SWR etc. wheres the SG Labs doesn‚Äôt.\nSG Labs ordering process is a reassuring one üòÖ. You email them, they let you know the price, you send them money on paypal and then you wait a few weeks for the shipping confirmation. Lead time was about 3 weeks for me."

    "text": "Assembly\nFor the most part, it‚Äôs not tricky to build. There‚Äôs almost no soldering and it‚Äôs just joining things together once you‚Äôve figured out the layout in the box and how you‚Äôre getting power and network to it. Depending on you situation this will be a breeze or a massive pain in the neck! I think my situation was somewhere in betewen, not easy but not impossible. Here are some photos of my build underway.\n\n\n\nUnpacking the dish\n\n\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a big ice cream\n\n\n\n\n\n1st receive testing\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the voltage\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy connectors\n\n\n\n\n\nOops!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team of expert dish aligners\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking alignment\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting the helix\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking some more holes\n\n\n\n\n\nBox of tricks\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting transmit\n\n\n\n\n\nWeatherproofing\n\n\nThe hardest parts for me was making up the fancy fittings on the LMR400 coax. There was a N type and a SMA fitting and they both had several parts and soldering of the pin. I fell foul to the usual thing of forgetting a bit and cutting off slightly too much. I also didn‚Äôt have a pair of wire cutters that could get through the coax ‚Äì it‚Äôs so thick! However, after making the ends up, I really like the cable, and going back to RG58 is like using thread after holding some rope!\nMy dish is located on a fake balcony, so it‚Äôs out the way but also not very accessible. I have to get the ladders out each time or climb out a bedroom window, this usually put me off doing much on an evening as I couldn‚Äôt be bothered with the ladders, and one of kids was sleeping in said bedroom! Overall I was very slow at putting it all together, but if you could dedicate a day to it, then you‚Äôd finish it in one go.\nAt my QTH, the dish elevation has to be at 20.5 degrees. I found this to be the absolute lower limit for my dish, whereby the scale starts at 20 degrees, and I think for an 80 cm dish it only goes to 22 degrees. However, I receive signals well so that‚Äôs good enough. If you‚Äôre any further north you‚Äôll have to get a non-standard mount, or possibly try installing it upside down, with the arm and LNB at the top. (This is for an offset dish)."

    "text": "Setting up the Pluto SDR\nBefore you pack the Pluto+ into the box, you‚Äôll want to setup the networking on it and verify it works. It‚Äôs quite straight forward. You plug it into your computer‚Äôs USB via the data socket and it‚Äôll show up as a drive. You want to edit the config.txt file, and find the section called USB Ethernet.\n[USB_ETHERNET]\nipaddr_eth = 192.168.1.200\nnetmask_eth = 255.255.255.0\nSet the IP to something for your network, ideally outside your router‚Äôs DHCP range. If you can‚Äôt do that, then give it an IP then set a reserved IP on your router for the Pluto+. I had to manually add a MAC address to the reserved IP, and now the router won‚Äôt give out .200 to anything else. Make sure you eject it/unmount it properly before disconnecting. You can then plug it into the network and see if you can ssh into it. The default username is root and password analog, and you should log in just fine.\nYou might also want to upgrade the firmware whilst you‚Äôre at it. DK1MI has a nice post on how to do that.\nI found the Pluto+ would make a new SSH key each time it booted up, and so SSH would complain that it didn‚Äôt match from last time (known_hosts) and prevent me from logging in. I avoided this with this entry in my ssh/config file:\nHost pluto\n  HostName 192.168.1.200\n  User root\n  StrictHostKeyChecking no\n  UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\nNow I can just type ssh pluto and it greets me with the logon prompt. &lt;security warnings etc.&gt;"

    "text": "Networking\nThe Pluto+‚Äôs built in gigabit network port is very convenient. Connecting it to my network in its place under the dish wasn‚Äôt. My temporary solution was to run a cable out the bedroom window. This is fine as a temporary setup, and even okay overnight during the summer. However, it was not a long term solution. I am fortunate that my house was built with network ports in all rooms, but the room underneath the dish has network ports that are nowhere near the right side of the house for the dish. I also had the problem of getting it out of the house, as I‚Äôd rather not drill holes though the walls if I can help it.\nOur garage has the heating boiler in it, and so has several large air vents. These just have grills over them on the inside and outside of the house and so I decided one of these would be the perfect conduit for network cable to get out of the house. However, there are no network drops in the garage, and it‚Äôs a good 20-25 m along two walls of the house to get from the vent to the dish. I was wanting a network connection in the garage, as it‚Äôs where I plan on having a workbench/shack setup at some stage, and running cables isn‚Äôt exactly the hardest DIY one can do! A big drill bit, and a long spool of cable and away I went.\n\n\n\nSerious problems need serious solutions\n\n\nThe office backs onto the garage, and makes a good place to connect into the network. I ended up getting three drill bits as the first wasn‚Äôt long enough, the second was for masonary and I hit wood, and then finally the 40cm wood bit went the whole way through! For a while I was worried I‚Äôd hit a water waste pipe, or worse, soil pipe, as the bathroom is above me, but it turned out to be a wooden stud. I tried running the wire along the wall outside, but it looked messy. Being dark blue against a light finish didn‚Äôt help, and so then I buried it in the gravel instead.\n\n\n\nRoute to the outside\n\n\n\n\n\nUgly\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy\n\n\nThe only problem with the network cable is that the plug is made up inside the box, and so I can‚Äôt remove the box from its location. The coax is made up inside but I can disconnect the other end from the dish and just carry it with the box. The network cable is not quite as easy, given it‚Äôs 30m back to the network port. I left lots of excess, so if I really do have to move it, I can just cut off the plug and pull it out of the grommet.\nI did think I could make an outdoor network switch, and have jumper cables between the boxes, and this would enable me to setup something else outdoors. Like raspberry pis, or other SDRs. I‚Äôd need a power setup but that would be fairly straightforward as there‚Äôs an external plug socket nearby. That‚Äôs a project for another day.\nNext up will be the software!\n\n\n\nSDR Console"

    "text": "Shortly after getting on the air with my Xiegu G90, I became intrigued by FT8. After some initial experimentation, I managed to set it up and began making QSOs. Initially, I was thrilled to hear stations from all over the world ‚Äì Australia, Japan, South America, and various other places. At first, I believed I could establish contact with all of them. However, after numerous attempts to connect with different stations, I discovered pskreporter. This tool allowed me to determine who could hear me. While it was disappointing to realize that hearing a station didn‚Äôt guarantee they could hear me, seeing the immediate feedback on pskreporter was just as enjoyable as making an actual contact, especially on days when distant countries could receive my signals.\nThe information provided by pskreporter makes FT8 interesting, especially when testing new antennas or different power levels. However, excessive usage of it can become somewhat monotonous. It‚Äôs convenient when used alongside other activities, but sitting in front of it for prolonged periods without any other engagement is not advisable. Depending on your antenna setup, you may find that you‚Äôre only able to reach specific parts of the world, making it nearly impossible to make new connections. While I occasionally manage to contact a few new countries with my horizontal EFHW antenna, it‚Äôs not as effective as a vertical, such as this one described by M0AWS.\nI found the user interface of WSJT-X somewhat lacking and soon discovered GridTracker. As it says on the website ‚ÄúGridTracker listens to traffic from WSJT-X and displays it on a map‚Äú. While it offers more functionality, that‚Äôs the core idea. I use its call roster to identify who‚Äôs calling or communicating, making my contacts based on that information. Only recently did I delve into the manual on the website and decide to pursue grid square chasing.\nA conversation in the Ham radio matrix chat about gamifying FT8 caught my attention. This intrigued me, as it seemed like a way to inject more interest into FT8. The most apparent approach was to start collecting grid squares from different countries. Now, I had a reason to contact those Italian and German stations. GridTracker proved to be highly useful for this purpose."

    "text": "Useful GridTracker Settings\nI encourage you to read the full manual, it‚Äôs not that long and you‚Äôll then understand the whole software much better. Here are the settings I‚Äôve discovered that simplify the process of collecting grid squares using the software.\n\nCall Roster\n\n\n\nTable of contacts\n\n\nI hardly ever use the map view in GridTracker. While it does display pskreport spots along with grids, the map can become cluttered, making it challenging to discern the information. I might briefly glance at the spot heatmap or switch to pskreporter for my spotters. My primary focus is on the call roster. This window is positioned next to WSJT-X‚Äôs main window and waterfall display. The call roster streamlines the substantial amount of information from WSJT-X into a concise, organized format. It allows for various filters, but I generally keep the filters quite open, toggling between all activity and CQ calls only.\nThe standout feature is the color coding of cells. A black background signifies a confirmed contact, a black-blue gradient indicates an unconfirmed contact, and a blue background represents a new grid. This arrangement allows me to quickly identify areas I still need to reach. With the CQ Only filter activated, it becomes easy to determine whom to respond to. Another setting I find useful is marking RR73 as a CQ. This way, I can spot stations just finishing up their last QSO, and I might have a chance to catch them as they start calling CQ.\nTo open the call roster, click on the Clipboard/Medal button in the menu. üìãü•á\n\n\nMap View\nAlthough I seldom use the map view, it serves as a useful tool to track your progress with grids. The heatmap of spots can also provide valuable insights. Ensure that you have the bands set to ‚ÄúMixed‚Äù rather than the default ‚ÄúAuto.‚Äù The Auto setting uses the band you‚Äôre currently on, which limts what you see, and unless your trying to get all the grids by band you probably want Mixed. Mixed displays all bands.\n\n\n\nMixed shows all bands\n\n\n\n\nLog data\nGrid Tracker is only useful if it knows all your logs. By default it‚Äôll read the wsjt-x log file on your computer but that won‚Äôt always have everything, and if you want to include voice or other modes that won‚Äôt help. The way I‚Äôve found to work best is to use its ability to import log data from elsewhere. There are a few options and you can set them in the Logging page of the settings.\n\n\n\nAll the logs\n\n\nGrid Tracker can pull and push log data. The Startup? and Menu? settings show the options for pulling log data, with startup meaning it queries it when you open Grid Tracker, and Menu meaning it adds a button to the menu for you to trigger a download. As you can see above the options are local files, psk-reporter, qrz, clublog and LoTW. I decided to go with LoTW as that seems to be the most commonly used central logging database. This means that wherever I capture my QSOs, as long as they get into LoTW, Grid Tracker will know about them. I could just add all of the others too.\nFor longer operating sessions with numerous QSOs, clicking the LoTW button in the menu will pull in confirmations. GridTracker maintains its own log, providing a record of your contacts.\nI also use GridTracker to send my WSJT-X logs to Cloudlog, my primary logbook. This process subsequently uploads all my logs to platforms like LoTW, Clublog, and eQSL. As indicated in the Log? column, GridTracker interfaces with various popular logging tools.\nIn essence, GridTracker‚Äôs configuration is straightforward and quick, enhancing the appeal of WSJT-X data and simplifying the tracking of contacts."

    "text": "Appreciating FT8\nWhile I‚Äôve been licensed for a relatively short time, I‚Äôve encountered strong opinions about FT8, including some negative viewpoints. I don‚Äôt enjoy coffee, but I wouldn‚Äôt tell coffee enthusiasts that they‚Äôre consuming it incorrectly. I won‚Äôt speculate on the reasons people dislike FT8, but instead, I‚Äôll share some observations that might not be immediately apparent.\nThese days, it‚Äôs common for unique locations to incorporate FT8 into their setups. Therefore, if you‚Äôre aiming to access new DX locations, FT8 offers a viable method. I also appreciate that it levels the playing field to some extent, unlike SSB or even CW. How often have I heard a VK or JA station (not rare DX, just less common), only to be faced with an overwhelming pileup as European countries with 2 kW power outputs drown out smaller stations like mine, operating at 100 W? Breaking through is nearly impossible. While CW might provide slightly better odds due to fewer operators compared to SSB, plus the reduced SNR needed to work someone, the challenge for QRP stations remains. With FT8, if your signal reaches them with 10W or 50W, your presence is acknowledged, significantly improving your chances. While there may be techniques for gaining an edge when working a pileup station on FT8, such as adjusting transmit settings or clock settings, the gap is much smaller. Skill is required here as well.\nWhen engaging with a popular station on SSB or CW, conversations are often minimal. Regular HF QSOs frequently consist of a brief exchange involving callsigns, RST, and possibly a name or location. This is not drastically different from an FT8 QSO. If your goal is to accumulate numerous contacts, reach various locations, or connect with rare stations, FT8 offers similar dynamics. If you seek in-depth discussions, FT8 isn‚Äôt the appropriate choice; it‚Äôs not a direct comparison. For that purpose, you might explore JS8Call.\nIn closing, while I risk getting sidetracked into an argument, I emphasize that the beauty of amateur radio as a hobby is rooted in personal enjoyment. If you find it enjoyable, that‚Äôs fantastic! If not, then there‚Äôs no obligation to pursue it; everyone‚Äôs preferences differ.\n\n\n\nGotta catch em all! üê≤üî¥üéÆüìª\n\n\nNow, back to the quilt!

    "text": "Feed point of random wire with 9:1 unun\n\n\nFor some reason, I tend to avoid trying out 15 meters, but yesterday I decided to give it a shot, and it went quite well. I began by experimenting with my 39.5-meter random wire antenna in the garden. It has excellent reception, and I could hear approximately 20 Japanese stations. However, when it came to transmitting, it didn‚Äôt perform as well as expected. I thought that the higher frequency of 15 meters might compensate for its low height, but according to pskreporter, it seemed that no one was receiving my signals. While I believe I managed to make a few QSOs, I eventually wanted to move indoors. The random wire is just a temporary setup, and I have to sit outside to use it.\n\n\n\nFar field plot at 15m on my random wire\n\n\nI switched back to using my EFHW (End-Fed Half-Wave) antenna, which still provided good reception. Being positioned at about 8 meters in height, it was much more effective for transmitting. My radio is currently set up in the kitchen, and I sit on the floor with a beanbag while operating it. I‚Äôm currently (or at least I like to think I am) in the process of designing a new workbench or shack in the garage. I‚Äôve also been contemplating the idea of remote operation. I wanted to continue designing my garage setup, but at the same time, I was making numerous FT8 contacts with desirable DX countries. Given that I‚Äôm using a Windows laptop with the radio, an obvious solution is the Remote Desktop Connection application. I‚Äôm not sure why I didn‚Äôt try it earlier. The only thing I needed to check was the audio settings, as the default settings would route the remote computer‚Äôs audio to me, causing WSJT-X to lose access to the soundcard. However, it‚Äôs a simple fix in the options to prevent this.\n\n\n\nAudio on remote computer\n\n\nWith that sorted out, WSJT-X and Grid Tracker could occupy one screen while I worked on the other comfortably from my desk. WSJT-X doesn‚Äôt have all the CAT commands required, so if I needed to adjust more settings on the radio, I‚Äôd have to use another program. I‚Äôm also unsure if CAT can control everything on the FT-DX10, such as the preset option I use for digital modes. For the time being, that‚Äôs acceptable since it‚Äôs just across the house.\nLast night, 15 meters, with occasional forays into 17 meters, turned out to be quite successful for me. There were instances of signal fading, and sometimes it took a while to receive a ‚ÄúRR73‚Äù reply from the other station, so whether or not everyone will log the QSOs depends on their perspective. Nonetheless, from my standpoint, we successfully exchanged signal reports.\n\n\n\nMap of world with spots showing QSOs\n\n\nI also found pskreporter not very reliable, as it would often show only two stations hearing me when I‚Äôd then get multiple replies to my CQ."

    "text": "After what feels like ages since I last ventured into the garden with my Yagi antenna and HT to attempt a contact via an FM satellite, I finally succeeded.\nLast time I struggled with holding all the things, trying to find the satellite and using the radio. I only managed to hear for a short period and that was it. So I decided to make a phone holder which goes on the antenna. I‚Äôve seen several people do this on YouTube, and there are lots of designs already made online. I printed this one, and bought a phone holder from Amazon that screws in.\n\n\n\nPhone Mount Ready\n\n\nIn practice it wasn‚Äôt quite as perfect as I thought it would be. It‚Äôs probably a few factors, not being perfectly aligned, maybe the metal in the antenna messes with the phone‚Äôs compass and perhaps other things but I had to hunt around a little for the satellite. Together with deciding at what orientation I should hold the antenna, and if it‚Äôs about time I change the frequency due to doppler, still left me feeling like I wasn‚Äôt going to have a chance.\n\n\n\nRadio and voice recorder\n\n\nI did simplify the radio and audio end. Last time I had a series of cables from the radio splitting the audio into the voice recorder and into ear phones. This was either directly connected to the radio or via the mini-fist mic which has the three buttons on. I thought those buttons might be useful for swithcing VFO and adjusting the memories which have the doppler corrections pre-programmed.\nThis time I put the voice recorder in my shirt top pocket, and held the HT and used it directly. No audio cables. This cleared out the clutter and meant I had one hand on the yagi and one on the radio.\nOne Sunday evening in July I decided to go out and try it. I‚Äôd seen SO-50 was coming up and had a reasonable pass of around 10-15 minutes and at a good elevation. It was coming up over the neighbour‚Äôs house and then I would see it. I found it pretty quick and heard M5JFS calling CQ. I replied but he made a QSO with someone else, however, he then ended with ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a GM5 station calling‚Äù. Here was my chance, and I made the contact!\n\n\nAudio of my first QSO\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\n\nHowever, in the excitement I lost the satellite and only heard the very beginning of John talking about it being my first satellite contact. I did find the satellite again and people had moved on. I didn‚Äôt manage to make another contact on that pass.\nHearing John and myself on the audio made me ‚Äúsee‚Äù how slick an experienced satellite operator is and how much thinking I was doing just to say what I did üòÖ.\nThe D72 is a full duplex radio, however, I didn‚Äôt hear myself on the downlink. Now perhaps I didn‚Äôt have some setting right (although I checked it several times), but when I emailed John afterwards and mentioned it, he suggested that I wasn‚Äôt hearing myself when I tx‚Äôd because the sat downlink is weakish relative to my uplink power and it was a fairly low pass. So even with filtering in the radio, there might still have been some de-sense going on sufficient to knock out my downlink.\nI have since made one more contact, also on SO-50, also not doing that great at keeping the satellite in my yagi‚Äôs path. I‚Äôve heard people talk about printing out the sat‚Äôs path, and then working out landmarks around my house and what bearing they are, to then try and follow the path without the AR phone app.\n\n\n\nOne of these looks good\n\n\nWhat I am thinking of doing, is building a rotator for the yagi, and having the computer control the tracking. I think it would be a fun project. I‚Äôve started buying some of the pieces for this simple rotator by the Australian SARCnet. It‚Äôs not a permanent setup but more of a sunny afternoon in the garden arrangement.\nHowever, at the moment, because of the sunny afternoons, and the school holidays, I haven‚Äôt had time to make it, and any free time I have had, I‚Äôve gone out to a SOTA summit instead! So it may take another 6 months before I build it and try for a satellite QSO again. Maybe next time I‚Äôll try a SSB one!\n\nUseful links\nSome links I‚Äôve saved for figuring out satellites:\n\nAMSAT Status page\nCalculate passes at your location\nAMSAT passes tracker\nAMSAT FM Frequency summary"

    "text": "Ever since I‚Äôve been on HF, I had the same EFHW in the back garden as my antenna. It‚Äôs been great, lots of contacts made all over the world on SSB and digital modes. Pretty much worldwide with FT8/4 but also good DX on SSB into South Africa, Japan, Brazil amongst others. Plus of course nice chats in UK/EU predominately across 40m and 20m. If the conditions are right, then pretty much any bit of wire in the air will work! However, I‚Äôve been looking to try something else, particularly a vertical and see how that works. I‚Äôve spoken to Mike, M0AWS, several times about different antenna and he recommended the vertical that he uses. It‚Äôs a multiband antenna from 80-10m and, as you can see from his article, he‚Äôs made many contacts with it around the world. It seemed like something that I could put up in the garden on a temporary basis and give it a go‚Ä¶so with my ordered delivered and wire measured I was ready to go!\n\n\n\nSchematic of setup\n\n\nThe antenna is fairly simple, and relies on a remote ATU to match the wire to the band of interest. I managed to pick up a CG-3000 from ebay recently, but there are many brands and options available, you can even use a manual tuner at the base - obviously less convenient. I‚Äôve seen the CG-3000 go for as little as ¬£75, although they‚Äôre typically around ¬£150. The radiating element is a 13.4m long piece of wire, attached to the CG-3000, up the side of the mast and then around 1m of it is tucked inside the mast. On the ground connector of the CG-3000 I connected an earth rod, suitable beaten into the ground around 60cm, and then four ~12m long radials laid on the ground at 90¬∞ to each other. The CG-3000 has a SO-239 connector for coax and a 4 pin connector for the power and control cable. Mine came with 5m of control cable, so that was my limiting factor in this setup. The controller on my unit was missing the power cable, it seemed to have been cut off only leaving two tiny ends of wire. I wanted to hook it into my Anderson powerpole junction box but turned out I had no red and black cables, and the replacement connector I found had the terminals the wrong way around. So I present the most error trap prone design for powering the CG-3000. My controller is an older model and says ‚ÄúTune‚Äù next to the button at the top, but really that‚Äôs reset - which is what it says on later models.\n\n\n\nPower and Reset - but you never need to press it\n\n\n\n\n\nIt works‚Ä¶but not recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nA wonky mast, pre-base fitting - also, it‚Äôs so tall!\n\n\nAs I knew this was a temporary setup I didn‚Äôt do anything too special with the mounting, I made use of a piece of 68mm diameter drain pipe, a kids toy structure, some straps and a piece of wood with a hole drilled for the pole and some for ground pegs. DJ0IP has lots of good information on using a spiderbeam pole, including mounting options. I found the wooden base was needed to keep it from tilting over, and luckily I had a holesaw of the right size. Although with the rubber cap on the bottom, it‚Äôs a tight fit and repeated taking in and out could rub the rubber away, so I might enlarge the hole a little. With the drain pipe mounted and the pole inside it was just a case of pulling up each section and tightening them. I think for long term installation, putting hose clamps at the base of each section, just above the section below, helps stop it collapsing. There‚Äôs lots of info online about this.\n\n\n\nATU at mast base\n\n\nI did install a ground post next to the tuner, but in retrospect, for a temporary setup, I think this wasn‚Äôt necessary‚Ä¶mostly as it was a pain to get back out again, which I‚Äôll come to later. I laid the radials out on the ground, trying to get them to cover the most space. The advantage of setting up in the middle of the garden is being able to lay them out in all directions. Any permanent home I find for it will likely be along one side of the garden, so the radials will have to just go where they can.\n\n\n\nTemporary kitchen shack\n\n\nMy shack isn‚Äôt convenient for this setup, particularly with only 5m of control cable - although I suppose there‚Äôs no need for the control to be next to the radio - so I just setup in the kitchen and ran the cables out the door. This temporary setup just used a big LiFePO4 battery for radio and ATU, and that lasted the whole time. For my testing I wanted to use FT4/8, so I hooked up the G90 to my laptop. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve used the G90 with WSJTX, and that ended up taking me a while to sort out. I wanted to use the IC-705 as it‚Äôs so easy to use with a computer, however, this doesn‚Äôt work with the ATU. The CG3000 will automatically match the frequency when it receives rf of about 3-5W. The IC-705 has a protection system that will immediately reduce the output power to 1W when it detects a high SWR, this means it won‚Äôt trigger the tuning. I‚Äôve seen people online use a manual tuner in between the 705 and ATU to prevent the 705 dropping the power and getting it to tune, they then bypass the manual one. Of course the AH-705 would be ideal for this situation and work effortlessly, perhaps perfect for portable/mobile setups. After some faffing things were fine. I could always put the radio into AM and hit the PTT and I could hear the relays working and watch the SWR drop.\nIt tuned every band from 80m to 10m, most were virtually 1.0 except 30m and 17m which were nearly 2, not sure why that was but they still worked fine and I made many contacts on 30m. I put out a test CQ on 20m to see what was what and the first pskreporter view was pleasing. I should‚Äôve saved the pskreporter view after my first 24 hours operation but I forgot.\n\n\n\nGood Tx on 20m\n\n\nBy the time I had it all sorted out on the first day, it was pretty late at night, so I had a look on 80m, 60m, and 40m. Lots of activity on 60m which I‚Äôve never really been on, so that was fun, and I spent most of the evening there. The next day I tried as many bands as I could. Conditions weren‚Äôt the greatest but I still managed some nice contacts with a few new DX locations. I did notice I could hear all around the world, and many places I‚Äôd never heard before, so that was fun too. The most exciting from a DX perspective was 15m, particularly early evening, there seemed to be several openings both east and west. They‚Äôd come and go, but around long enough to make a QSO.\n\n\n\nMy weekend‚Äôs activity\n\n\nHighlights included California, Uruguay, Kyrgyzstan, Svalbard, Japan and Australia. I had potential to get some South Asia, pskreporter showed I was heard there, but never managed to get a QSO. These were all with 20W FT8 from the G90.\n\nActivity Summary\n\n\nBand\nQSOs\nHighlights\n\n\n\n\n80m\n2\nUkraine\n\n\n60m\n10\nAland Islands\n\n\n40m\n5\n\n\n\n30m\n17\n\n\n\n20m\n6\nAustralia, Svalbard\n\n\n17m\n2\nCalifornia\n\n\n15m\n16\nBarbados, Uruguay, Brazil, Kyrgyzstan, Japan\n\n\n\nAll in all, 30 countries, three or four new DX, and furthest contact was with VK3JLM, at 16,864 km. Pretty good I think!\nSunday afternoon, it was time to pack it away, and this is when I realised the ground rod might not have been such a good idea. A rod hammered over 0.5m into the ground doesn‚Äôt tend to want to come out that easily. Several places online suggested a jack to lift it out, I don‚Äôt have one of those, and someone suggested a drill and watering the ground. So that‚Äôs what I did. You have to be careful as the drill wants to turn and the rod doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶but once it‚Äôs loosened off, then drilling and pulling up brings it out.\n\n\n\nBish bash Bosch\n\n\nNow all that‚Äôs left is to figure out how to set it up more permanently. Ideally it needs to go away from the house, but then it needs a lot of cabling running around the garden. There‚Äôs also the fact that it‚Äôs not the most attractive thing in the garden, even I admit that, and the best place is probably in full view of the kitchen and lounge. I‚Äôve read about people painting them grey/blue to soften their impact on the surroundings. I‚Äôll have to think about it. Probably for now, it‚Äôll be temporary setups, and hopefully I‚Äôll get slicker at that so I can pop it up for the day/evening and then take it down in the morning and not get in anyone‚Äôs way. MM0OPX has a nice video on quickly setting up a spiderbeam."

    "text": "TinyGS, is a network system to retrieve LoRa satellite data using ESP devices, much like SatNOGS. Everything is managed via the GitHub repo and the Telegram channels.\nGetting started and flashing the software on devices is very easy via their web installer. You then request a username and password via their Telegram bot. I‚Äôm not detailing much as their instructions are plain and the process is super easy. You do have to use Telegram but it‚Äôs okay.\nThey have a list of supported hardware, and whilst the V3 isn‚Äôt mentioned, people on Telegram says it works. Plus when I flashed mine, it came up in the dropdown to choose it. However, it only showed the 433 MHz version.\nTelegram is fine and that, but like Discord, it‚Äôs not the easiest to find useful information. Compared to Discourses forum or Github issues etc., however, it does cost the project team nothing so I don‚Äôt begrudge them that. You can search posts but it takes a lot of effort to work through them and likely multiple conversations happening at the same time. Hence this post‚Ä¶\nYou can change the frequency by logging into the webadmin, which, strangely, is actually the public website and not the dashboard that runs locally on your device. You have to request a link from the TinyGS telegram bot with /weblogin and it produces a tinygs.com url for you. As it‚Äôs Telegram I‚Äôm using my phone for it, no doubt there‚Äôs a computer client too.\nYou then click on your station, and a new menu appears.\nThe top dropdown lets you change it to 868 (or 900+ depending on your region) MHz, and voila!"

Because there are only four supported satellites and at ~900 MHz you‚Äôll need a decent antenna to pick up the data and I‚Äôm not sure the device can manage the doppler shift well enough to get anything meaningful. Just get a 433 MHz device and enjoy the experience. üõ∞Ô∏è"

I‚Äôve seen several people on YouTube use small mics and I‚Äôve seen some for sale on eBay but when I found this design, I knew I had to build one.\n\n\n\nTesting, testing, 123\n\n\nThe site has a list of what you need and most of the components can be found on aliexpress for a very low price. You just have a wait a bit for delivery. You end up with 10 or more of each and my total was around ¬£5 delivered.\nIt is very small! First I connected it up with what I thought was thin hook up wire but it was too big and difficult when I tried to squeeze it into the case.\n\n\n\nFull of wires\n\n\nI used some of the sotabeams thin wire I‚Äôd made an antenna from and this was much better. I also placed each component inside the 3D print and measured out the wire more precisely. It was fiddly but meant there wasn‚Äôt too much extra wire to squeeze in.\n\n\n\nNeatly tucked in\n\n\nThe top half of the case clicks together but does need a fair amount of force to get it on. The nut for the 3.5mm socket holds that in place and we‚Äôre ready to go.\n\n\n\nSide by side with MH3\n\n\nI might make one for the G90 next."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was hungry for points, and wanted something a bit more challenging to try out, and whilst browsing sotlas and chatting with the Aberdeenshire SOTA WhatsApp group, Morven was decided.\n\n\n\nMake sure I wasn‚Äôt hungry in other ways\n\n\n\n\n\nView of the way up\n\n\nI climbed from the east side, parking along the road just at a junction. Space for maybe 5 cars here. You walk across the field and past an abandoned house. As you go through the gate you have to turn right immediately on a faint looking track otherwise you‚Äôll be off walking around the hill wondering why you aren‚Äôt going up. It‚Äôs not very obvious at all, but after a little while the track starts to appear again. I‚Äôd been warned!\n\n\n\nViews to the south\n\n\nThe gradient steps up quite a bit and it‚Äôs a pretty relentless 300m climb. It starts to level out and you think you must be nearly there‚Ä¶but no you‚Äôre probably only about half way, but at least it‚Äôs nearly flat for a while. This process repeats and you think you‚Äôre nearly there again after climbing another steep section but no! Still a bit further to go.\n\n\n\nA false summit\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real summit\n\n\nIt was a glorious day at the top and I tried 2m FM first. I just have the slightly longer whip on the Boafeng, it‚Äôs okay but not the best. Others seem to have the slim G antenna from Spectrum communications, so I might need to get one of those. Only ¬£20. I had 3 on 2m, and then tried the repeater and got one of the same people again!\n\n\n\nNeed a longer arm\n\n\nI then setup HF, it was quite windy and the pole was getting blown about a lot but it was fine. I was trying out my newly made EFHW. It would only tune with a counterpoise but I think my feedpoint might be too close to the ground, however, it still works so that‚Äôs all that matters at the top!\n\n\n\nEFHW 49:1 transformer\n\n\n\n\n\nView of antenna looking south\n\n\nManaged 11 contacts on 20m, including a summit to summit in France. 40m seemed completely dead with just a local contact being the only one.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nA couple of folks started up the hill a bit after me, I was probably at the gate when they left the car park but I think the steepness slowed them down considerable as I was on my way back down before I met them.\nBack down was easier although you had to be careful with loose stones on the path when it was quite steep. Driving home I did a big sneeze in the car and felt something strange in my abdomen, this later turned out to be an inguinal hernia. Eugh.\n\n\n\nSummit selfie"

    "title": "Mount Keen",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Start of the ascent\n\n\nAnother day off and the forecast was promising blue skies and sunshine. I‚Äôd spent the evenings this week trawling sotlas trying to figure out where to go. It was our youngest‚Äôs P1 stay and play this morning, plus swim training after school, so I had to fit my trip into that window. I‚Äôve been finding I go faster than OS Maps walking prediction but yet to keep detailed enough records to figure out my speed, so planning a new location is always hit or miss (along with the alerts I post!) To complicate matters more, I was planning on cycling the first part of the route before walking. I settled on Mount Keen and left after a fun session with the P1s.\n\n\n\nOS Map of the route\n\n\nI was also going to go the Glen Esk route, from the south, vs.¬†the Glen Tanar one from the north. I thought it was a closer drive to home, but it was actually further, however, I think the walk is shorter this way. The road into Glen Esk seems to go on and on and on! Plus no end of dumb pheasants to watch out for on the road. I‚Äôve actually done this hill before, maybe 12/13 years ago and on that trip we ended up walking through a blizzard! I can‚Äôt remember if we even made it to the top or decided to head back down, to then find the stream crossing to be more challenging than the way up!\n\n\n\nStream crossing\n\n\nI cycled from the car park, just before the Lochlee Parish Church, along the north side of the river. My bike is a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù which is more road bike than mountain bike but has thickish tyres. I think this was probably the limit for it, as it was quite rocky and the ride was very rattly! I made it, and it cut off a good chunk of time but wasn‚Äôt always pleasant. I set off at 10:45 from the car park, and cycled for 30 minutes to just before the stream crossing in the picture above. The terrain is fairly flat with only a small incline the whole way. You also pass the Queen‚Äôs Well, which is nice to look at if you‚Äôve never seen it before.\n\n\n\nLooking back and Queen‚Äôs Well\n\n\nThe path is very clear and well made the whole way, some places its been eroded by water, or repaired with big chunks of rock. The roadway keeps going and you have to make sure you turn off towards Mount Keen.\n\n\n\nA good view back down the Glen on the way up\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal path to the summit (beyond the ridge)\n\n\nAfter an hour I‚Äôd reached the top and had my HT out as MM0VPM was on Sgor Gaoith and I was hoping for a summit to summit. Seems the weather wasn‚Äôt as good with him inland, and the snow I could see in the distance was probably where he was! I heard GM4CCN calling CQ and tried to answer but the Aberdeen folk thought I was calling CQ and called me back. Made a couple of contacts on the telescopic RH770 with the new FT-65 before setting up the slim G off to the side.\n\n\n\nMade it!\n\n\nThere were quite a few folks on the summit so I was over to the west side. Not sure if that was the best as I was in the shadow of the cairn and perhaps they might‚Äôve been blocking my signal. I heard GM4CCN a few more times and we tried to have a QSO. I found holding the PTT on the FT65 difficult when my hands were getting cold, that I don‚Äôt think I was actually transmitting and so we never made the QSO. Bill, GM0NRT, kept saying I dropped out but I think it was not holding the PTT. I was probably holding it wrong, in my right hand and using my finger on the PTT, vs.¬†my left and using my thumb. Or I should‚Äôve put on a glove.\n\n\n\nLochnagar\n\n\nI tried the slim G for a bit, had a couple more but not as many as I thought I‚Äôd get on this summit. I switched to HF with the 5.5m vertical and tried 20m. A good reply on 20m with 16 in the log. I did try 10m for a bit. I heard a VK station absolutely booming in, who was talking to a MW0 station in Wales, but only one reply to my CQ. By this time I was getting cold and I‚Äôd been on the summit an hour, and should probably be getting back.\n\n\n\nTowards Aberdeen\n\n\nAs I was packing up a lady, who I‚Äôd passed on my bike, asked me to take a photo of her. She also asked if I was a Russian spy. I said a good spy wouldn‚Äôt reveal if they were one - but also that could be double bluffing. We ended up walking back down together until I got to my bike. She was trying to complete all the Munros, and had about 20-odd left. I thought about making my excuses and running ahead but it was nice having a little chat and she wasn‚Äôt really any slower than me.\nThe bike ride back was easier as slightly downhill, so only took 20 minutes, and I was back at the car in no time, and home with 30 minutes to spare! Although only 12% battery in the car. The journey out had used 51% of the battery, which was slightly worrying but I suspect it was the colder morning, and now it was 15 C."

    "title": "Geallaig Hill",
    "section": "",
    "text": "My auntie was visiting for the weekend and she‚Äôs a keen hill walker, so of course we had to go out! I picked Gaellaig Hill as it‚Äôs not too long, and close to Ballater for a nice lunch afterwards and then still home in time to do school pick up.\nWhilst yesterday the weather was lovely, and the forecast looked great over the weekend, today was much greyer and wetter. Thankfully it had stopped raining by the time we reached the start, and even a little blue sky appeared.\n\n\n\nLooking back down the hill\n\n\nThe walk up was straight forward, following the track right to the summit. I forgot to take any photos of the summit, but there‚Äôs a nice cairn you have to climb into with the trig point, and you‚Äôre very well protected from any wind. The rain less so, for obvious reasons.\nWhilst the radio is somewhat of a novelty for her, I didn‚Äôt think that would last long. Fraser, MM0EFI, knew I was going up and we had a quick QSO on 2m, but then I jumped straight to 20m on HF. It was quite a considerable pile up and I really struggled to make anyone out. There was some QRM, tuning, tones that kept sounding too which made it harder. Probably if I had headphones on I would‚Äôve done better but I at least wanted auntie to be able to hear.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nHad a few England and Welsh stations come back who were booming signals, and cut through the pile up! Quite the short skip on 20m. Managed three summit-to-summits in England, Italy and Germany too.\nAfter about 30 minutes, it was time to pack up and head back down‚Ä¶and warm up again! We went into Ballater - the first time I‚Äôve actually been there! - had lunch at The Bothy and had a look around a few shops. Some classic granny shops on the high street!\n\n\n\nSmile!"

    "title": "Strathfinella Hill",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Another hill, this time to the south of Aberdeen. The weather was wet and windy in the morning, particularly so inland, so thought I‚Äôd stick to the coast. The two options were Strathfinella or Hill of Garvock. Reports of angry cows from Garvock, plus the sheltered nature of the wooded summit of Strathfinella made the decision for me.\nConsulting Fraser, MM0EFI, the local SOTA expert, I was going to climb it from the south, following forestry roads and mountain bike paths. Looked to be fairly short route and a quick claim to the top. It‚Äôs only a one pointer, so never going to be that far.\n\n\n\nRoute from the south\n\n\nThe weather was pretty good, breezy but some sun and mild. The route was straightforward- literally. There were a few bikers around who I met just before the turn off to the summit.\n\n\n\nLeft or right? Nope. Straight on.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a chat with some of the mountain bikers but just said I was out for a walk. Too much effort to get into the real reason! They pointed me towards the trig point which was off to the side of the main path. I almost missed it whilst walking along! It‚Äôs right in the trees, and reminded me of the portal stones from the Realm of the Enderlings book series!\nI set up 2m first and got a guy down in Brechin, unfortunately he was the only 2m QSO. I spent a long time calling and then decided to move to HF.\nThe summit is a bit of a black spot for mobile reception and I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that. I use my phone for 2m spotting and for SOTA spotting or looking up other activators. I‚Äôve signed up and registered for APRS to SOTA, and SOTAMAT, a FT8 spotter, and maybe even a SMS one, but do I know how to use them?! üòÖ\nI eventually managed to spot myself on 40m and got a few contacts. 20m spot did work but no one ever came back to me‚Ä¶even though I‚Äôd had a few contacts with other callers.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nI managed two S2S contacts in Germany. One was an exchange of 11-31 each way but we managed to get my callsign and SOTA reference communicated.\nOn the way down I thought about doing Hill of Garvock but I hadn‚Äôt packed lunch and still had to get back home. Maybe a double activation next time!"

    "text": "It‚Äôs the summer holidays and so the kids are home all the time, or we‚Äôre away etc. and I didn‚Äôt think I would get to do very much SOTA during the holidays. However, today the younger ones were off on a play date with some friends, so that just left my eldest and I at home. Left to her own devices she would spend all her time on devices! So I figured we should go climb a hill!\nMy usual research method of browsing the sotlas map and asking the WhatsApp group led to Craiglich with the prospect of a tea room afterwards. The tea room was the real winner here. üç∞\n\n\n\nPath to the top\n\n\nThere‚Äôs a small car park on the north side of the road and after climbing a rickerty gate, we were off!\n\n\n\nHappy to start\n\n\nThe path starts along through a field and then enters the forest. It‚Äôs a little wet and boggy at first, but nothing major. The pathway is quite narrow with heather and pines growing close by. I was wearing shorts and was beginning to regret that idea on the grounds of tick risk! Although I managed the whole walk without any incident.\n\n\n\nThrough the forest\n\n\nThere‚Äôs only one real turn that you have to look for in the forest, where you bear to the left to climb the hill. At this point it‚Äôs a little steeper but overall the path is gentle and very pleasant. You come out of the forest into the open area with nice purple heather covering the hillside. I‚Äôd recently bought Sotagoat app, so my daugther was using it to track the summit. It‚Äôs a convenient app for finding the summit and telling you when you‚Äôre in the activation area. It offers an offline database too, so you can find information without phone reception, and finally spotting is easy from it. Probably does more but I‚Äôve not looked into it too much yet.\nWe reached the top and I setup my slim G on the mast on the cairn, with the D72 and called CQ on 2m FM. I spoke to the locals, including Chris, MM7RVC, who‚Äôd literally just completed his intermediate exam and had passed. So we all congratulated him on that! I also spoke with Bruce, MM6BWS, who was a new local contact for me.\n\nI did hear another station on a summit, and heard him having a QSO with MM7MOX (Andy), although I couldn‚Äôt hear Andy. Looking at MM7MOX‚Äôs activations and logs, he was on Torlum (GM/SS-227) at the time I think it must‚Äôve been Lee, MM7LEF/P, on Scald Law (GM/SS-125) that I could hear. He was working 2m FM at exactly the time I could hear him as it was interrupting my chat with Bruce. Pretty amazing as it‚Äôs almost 150 km away and there are big hills between us. Aircraft scatter? I don‚Äôt know, I should email him!\n\n\n\nThat is quite the distance!\n\n\nI got my four and this trip was not about contacts, so we packed and headed down the hill in preparation for the best part of the trip!\nWe were going to go to Tarland tea room but when I looked at the map I saw there was one in Lumphanan and that was on our route home, so seemed a better choice. Alas! it proved no good as they only took cash and I had none. The nearest cash machine was miles away and, being a Sunday, the local post office was shut. That was a shame as it looked a lovely little tea room. So we continued on into Banchory and found somewhere there. The Birdhouse cafe. It was fine - a bit too hipster coffee house for me but I had a cup of tea and my daugther a can of diet coke.\nOur other task was to find some jam sugar after our strawberry picking, and it seems the only store in Aberdeenshire that had any was the Morrisons in Banchory - whilst it was the last shop we visited it wasn‚Äôt the first!\n\n\n\nHappy smiles all round\n\n\nMaybe we‚Äôll manage another in the holidays‚Ä¶and I‚Äôll have to be better prepared on the tea shop side!"

    "text": "After a lovely¬†Lochnagar trip the other week (with the now amusing subtitle of windy munro), I was keen to do some more high summits before the weather got worse and the darkness set in. Although turns out the weather is already worse! It‚Äôs school holidays here, so with no family schedule constraints, I could go out for the whole day, and I decided to try these two big uns - Ben Avon and Beinn A‚ÄôBhuird, pronounced Ben Ann and Ben a Vour respectively.\n\n\n\nJourney there and back\n\n\nThe route is pretty standard for these two, parking at Keiloch, paying the ¬£3.50, then cycling, before hiking. I decided to bike as far as I could towards The Sneck (the T junction between the two summits at 986m), and just retrace my steps from Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird back. This is instead of doing the loop where you walk from Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird North Top (the full summit name) to South Top across the plateau, then down the side and meet the path again after crossing Quoich Water. As I could see the low cloud I thought I‚Äôd rather not be walking that route for the first time, and just retrace my steps. Although given my ‚Äúretracing‚Äù aka wildly veering route, and the completely indistinguishable terrain, it probably didn‚Äôt matter. It also meant more cycling on the way in, which helped my timing, for a chance of a good summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, on Mull.\n\n\n\nInto the Valley\n\n\nThe route in has a few parallel paths, including the Fairy Glen, and I‚Äôm not sure I took the best ones, and had to push the bike up some steep rocky parts in places. I tried the other way on the way back and it wasn‚Äôt much better, and then I missed the turn and went through the Fairy Glen - although didn‚Äôt see the secret howff (a hidden bothy), but also didn‚Äôt look very hard as I wanted to get back.\n\n\n\nLooking back along Gleann an t-slugain route\n\n\n\n\n\nLow route from fairy glen\n\n\n\n\n\nSome snow on Carn Faiclach\n\n\n\n\n\nPath up to The Sneck\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of waterfalls\n\n\nThe weather was reasonable in the morning, patches of sun between the clouds and fairly mild for 8am. The forecast had the summits in cloud with strong winds, 30-40 mph with gusts of 50 mph. However, until I got to The Sneck, there was minimal wind, but boy, once I did! üå¨Ô∏è It was absolutely relentless, with my hood acting like a reed in a trumpet with an enthusiastic player. I gave the edge a wide berth, not trusting myself if there was a sudden gust that I wasn‚Äôt braced for. Snow was minimal on the way to the Ben Avon summit, with just small pockets that resisted being blown away.\n\n\n\nA bleak route to the summit\n\n\nOut of the mist the tor emerges and I have arrived! Peaking through the rock formation - which acted like the mouth piece of the trumpet - revealed more snow on that side.\n\n\n\nSnow on the east side of the tor\n\n\nI found a nice rock to hide behind and setup the slim G on the carbon mast. My last activation on Carn a‚ÄôGheoidh, suffered a lot from the mast bending too much in the wind and the antenna sliding off. Up until this point, I‚Äôd forgotten about this and so hadn‚Äôt prepared anything else. Luckily the slight sheltering seem to keep the antenna on and I managed to make my QSOs. The most exciting was a summit to summit with Fraser, MM0EFI, who‚Äôs on Mull and was up GM/SI-016, 100 miles away. We were both on HTs and slim G antenna!\n\n\n\n160km summit to summit on 2m FM\n\n\nOff to the next summit! The walk was barren, non-identifiable and had much more snow, oh, plus the wind continued.\n\n\n\nSelfie at the top"

We were staying near St.¬†Andrews, which is quite a flat area, however, there are a few granite lumps you can climb. Today‚Äôs one was Largo Law. If the weather was good, we‚Äôd have a lovely view of the Forth, Edinburgh and East Lothian. However, that wasn‚Äôt the case today‚Ä¶more like gray and cloudy.\n\n\n\nSummit ahead!\n\n\nThe route is straight forward, as shown on Sotlas, park at the school/cemetery, up towards the farm and then straight up the hill! The track was tricky in places as the ground was dry and covered in loose soil, but we made it up fine.\n\n\n\nLooking back down the path over the Firth of Forth\n\n\nI setup the slim g on the 6m carbon mast, put out a spot and called CQ. It took a few calls but stations did start coming back. Good coverage across Glasgow, Edinburgh and up to Montrose area. Had a nice chat with GM4PKJ, who lives very close to where we used to live around 10 years ago. His wife is a ham too, but I didn‚Äôt realise until I got home and looked him up on QRZ, otherwise I could‚Äôve said hi to her too.\n\n\n\nHorses in the field\n\n\nGot my four contacts and packed up. My wife was sat nearby and commented the radio conversation was so ‚Äúold man‚Äù. It was mostly what‚Äôs the weather and setup but I probably do adopt some old man tendencies when talking‚Ä¶it‚Äôs as though you‚Äôve got to fit in. I should just ignore that and say whatever I want. Although I do like describing the weather on a summit, as quite often it‚Äôs different from ‚Äúground‚Äù level.\n\n\n\nHeard across the water\n\n\nI had my Lora tracker with me and looked up if I‚Äôd been tracked. Two stations across the water had followed me up and down the summit. One was a new one in the centre of Edinburgh owned by GM5AUG.\n\n\n\nGM5AUG-6\n\n\nWe headed back down and then back to the hotel, to enjoy the silence of no kids for the rest of the weekend!\n\n\n\nSmile!"

So I was more prepared with lunch and routes this time.\nFirst was Hill of Fare. There‚Äôs a car park called Back of Hill of Fare on the B993 where there‚Äôs space for 5-10 cars by the side of a log store. I then followed the path up from there. A couple of new looking fences have been installed but there are some nice gates. They had very high handles, which I thought was strange, but then someone pointed out they‚Äôre for horse riders.\n\n\n\nGood views on the way up\n\n\nProbably took around 50-60 minutes to reach the top. It‚Äôs quite a wide opening at the top, with some small pools of water.\nI didn‚Äôt want to hang about long, so 2M FM got me 3 contacts and then I switched to 70cm to activate the summit. Three people, 4 callsigns and 2 bands in about 10 minutes! Time to go to the next one, and hopefully arrive in time to catch Chris, MM7RVP, going up Cairn-mon-earn for a summit to summit contact.\n\n\n\nSlim G on the pole"

However, I couldn‚Äôt find a route that I could walk the lot in one day, certainly not one December day in the light. I did find that I could chain together four individual walks and drive between the starting points. But I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could fit it all in, leaving home at 7am and being back by 5pm. So I settled on multiple visits. Plus Gerald, G4OIG, was going to be visiting at the end of the week and doing some of the summits in the area and I thought it would be nice to meet in person, as well as a chance for 2m S2Ss, so I‚Äôd want to return on the Thursday.\n\n\n\nCar park in the morning\n\n\nFor the Monday, I‚Äôd decided on Monamenach, Badandun Hill and then Mealna Letter, and then the Thursday I‚Äôd do Ben Gulabin, GM/CS-077, then Mount Blair. Interestingly the last person on Ben Gulabin was Gerald, almost exactly a year ago! This would let me have a S2S with Gerald and then meet him at the bottom of Mount Blair afterwards.\nAs Gerald was visiting, we knew the weather would be bad. It was forecast to snow overnight, and I was concerned about the roads, but looking on the snow gate cameras in the morning, it seemed like it was okay. I set off just after 7am, to arrive around 8:40am. First stop was Monamenach, the highest of the group.\n\n\n\nRoute taken\n\n\nIt was a nice clear day, although chilly and windy - particularly on the summits - and brisk walk up from parking by the river, soon got me to the top of the hill.\n\n\n\nSummit on right\n\n\n\n\nWhilst there are a lot of handy posts at the summit, there was no shelter and it was blowing an icy gale. I followed the fence line down a little, and found a rock to hide behind. I setup on 2m and called my first CQ of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt too long and I had 4 contacts across Edinburgh and Glasgow. Fraser and others tried calling and listening back in Aberdeen area, but no luck. It started to sleet and I still had two more to go, so time to return to the car.\n\n\n\nAcross to Badandun Hill\n\n\n\n\n\nSummit cairn of fence posts\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the summit\n\n\n\n\n\nA small sheltered spot from the wind\n\n\n\n\n\nBack down though the snow\n\n\nTime for hill number 2!"

When you come out of the trees, then the path disappears and you just make your way up the hill. It‚Äôs hard to go wrong as you‚Äôre aiming for the junction of the walls on the top of the first hill.\n\n\nYou then follow the wall along the top until you get to the summit. If you‚Äôre lucky the wall can be a wind break and makes it a pleasant walk. The summit cairn is away from the wall, and is worth visiting as it offers some nice views down to the loch below.\n\n\nThe sky was still clear and offered stunning views all around.\n\nAfter two summits on VHF, I thought I‚Äôd try HF, particularly with the nice wall to shelter behind, and so setup for 40m.\n\nI had a nice run on 40m, and start chasing summits on other bands. By this time it was 1:30pm and I was 1:30 ahead of schedule. I was starting to debate if I had enough time for a fourth! Ideally, I wanted to be leaving the area at 3:30pm to get home by 5, so if I could run back to the car by 2pm, then I‚Äôd have time‚Ä¶not for Mount Blair but for it‚Äôs neighbour, Meall Mor, GM/ES-058.

    "text": "Looking NE\n\n\nThe kids have been enjoying the previous adventures we‚Äôve gone on, and wanted to go out again. Tim, GM5OLD, was going to be going up Sgor Mor but had hurt his knee on the descent of Morven, so called it off. I‚Äôd originally planned to go up Craigendarroch, as that‚Äôs likely to be in reach, via 2m, of Sgor Mor, but as we weren‚Äôt constrained by that anymore, I decided Fourman Hill would be a good summit. It‚Äôs quite a low summit and the route up is short, around 1.3 km with 115m of elevation change. Makes for a nice pleasant walk, also when you‚Äôre carrying a tent, lunch for four and various things the kids want, you appreciate the short trip! If I was on my own, it would‚Äôve only taken 20 minutes to get to the top.\n\n\n\nLooking south\n\n\nPerhaps I should‚Äôve done it that day I did three 1-pointers in the area - then I could‚Äôve used Mike‚Äôs, 2M0WNA, joke about being a four hill man.\n\n\n\nFollowing the leader\n\n\nWeather was good today, nearly clear blue skies, although some wind, particularly on the summit. The walk up is mostly sheltered by trees but when you near the top these are sparse and we were getting blown about quite a bit. The trig point is in the middle of some gorse and there‚Äôs not much space around it. We found a nearby tree in the heather to setup camp.\n\n\n\nTent and station\n\n\nThe kids kept out of the wind in the tent and had their lunch in there. I setup just behind a tree and used another to tie off the random wire in more of an inverter L shape rather than the usual inverted sloper L. I also had the slim G on the mast for 2m. Fraser, MM0EFI, was first in the log on 60m. I thought others would come but after about 10-15 minutes of calling, no-one else appeared so I moved to 40m. Whilst the CQ Worldwide DX Contest was going on, there was still space on the band and I worked 5 stations - including Tim, GM5OLD, from his camper van across at Glenshee.\n\n\n\nGM5OLD Station\n\n\nAs the contest was on, I thought I‚Äôd make the most of it and see what DX I could work. I moved to 10m and the band was chock-a-block! I started with a few European and Russian contacts, and they were easy to work. Everyone just gives you a 59 in a contest so not sure what my signal really was but when they come back after my first call and get my callsign correct, it must be a pretty decent signal. I saw Barbados, 8P5A, on the cluster, so thought I‚Äôd give them a try. It took a few attempts but eventually managed to get through! My first transatlantic SOTA QSO!\n\n\n\nQSOs - Green is 10m\n\n\nI switched the antenna to the 5.5m random vertical and started at 29.000 MHz and worked down. Lots of US stations at this end of the band and pretty much each one I tried, came back straight away. I heard many stations worldwide, Canada, Aruba, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, but didn‚Äôt manage to work them. It‚Äôs always a trade off of how long do you keep calling them before you decide they can‚Äôt hear you due to propagation vs.¬†being drowned out by bigger stations. Plus the kids had had enough by this point and wanted to move on.\n\n\n\nHeading back down\n\n\nI did join the lunchtime net and made a couple of local contacts on 2m, I didn‚Äôt spot on 2m or try calling, as I wanted to spend the time on 10m instead. We were back to the car in 20 minutes and nearly everyone fell asleep on the way home! A friend at work asked me about good walks for kids, and thanks to SOTA. I now have a long list of nice walks to recommend!\n\n\n\nCheese!\n\n\nAnd I‚Äôm in another of Fraser‚Äôs videos‚Ä¶ üòÖ"

    "text": "Ben Macdui is Scotland‚Äôs (and the UK‚Äôs) second highest mountain at 1,309 m, only beaten by 36m by the famous Ben Nevis. My journey continues from Carn A‚Äô Mhaim, whereby I walked along the ridge, then down (unfortunately) to the side of Ben Macdui. I‚Äôd caught up with the lady who passed me at the previous summit, and so we ended up walking to the summit of Ben Macdui together. She was visiting from Manchester and staying a few days in Braemar. She asked lots of questions about amateur radio and seemed interested, particularly in SOTA. Once we started going back up the hill it was just boulders for as far as the eye can see - although we were once again in the cloud so not that far.\n\n\n\nThe start of the ascent - lady in the foreground for scale\n\n\n\n\n\nLast view before climbing into the clouds\n\n\nThe path came and went a few times as we went up, occasionally small patches of red sandstone gravel could be spotted, and we followed that as best we could. We came to a small stream to cross and that meant we were nearing the top, and the boulders eased off. Soon enough the trig point and cairn appeared in the cloud and we‚Äôd made it!\n\n\n\nTrig point\n\n\n\n\n\nMarker from 1920s\n\n\nThere were a few other people at the top, and a trickle of walkers continued for most of the time I was there. I looked around and found another sheltered cairn to setup behind. There wasn‚Äôt much wind at the top, but being in the cloud was a bit damp. Water would condense on the mast and wires and then drip down onto me (and radio if I wasn‚Äôt careful).\n\n\n\nSummit setup\n\n\nI had hoped 2m would be good from up here, certainly during the 145 Alive event, Fraser made contacts all over Scotland and north England. However, after Fraser and calling CQ a few times it seemed no-one was listening and I went to 40m - I also knew I had a long way back to go and didn‚Äôt want to hang about too long. 40m was good, with 13 contacts, including a summit to summit with 2W0OMX on GW/SW-001 - the tallest Brecon Beacon in Wales. As I was thinking of packing up I heard a mobile station call on 2m, and had a brief chat with him. I‚Äôd been on the air for about 30 minutes and it was time to pack up and head down.\n\n\n\nUh oh - broken tip of mast\n\n\nThe lady (who I never asked her name) who climbed with me had gone on to do the big loop around Derry Cairngorm and back to Derry Lodge. I‚Äôd looked at that route but it would add at least 30 minutes, and I was on a schedule to get home for 5pm, so I‚Äôll save that Munro for next year. A bit of wandering around and I found my route down, and after not very long the clouds started to part and the views improved considerably!\n\n\n\n\nCloud over Cairn Toul\n\n\n\n\n\nRidge walk from Carn A‚Äô Mhaim\n\n\n\n\n\nRoute down\n\n\nI soon found the path in the photo above, and then it was plain sailing from there. It did get quite steep in places on the way down but manageable. The cloud had cleared more in the glen too, so looking back the mountainsides were impressive to see.\n\n\n\nDescent route on right, and ridge on left\n\n\nMy route back to my bike made me realise I didn‚Äôt want to leave my bike right by the bridge as now I had to go down to get it. Going down was easy enough but then getting my bike back was a pain. I decided to carry my bike back up to the top path but this was a mistake as the path was narrow, rocky and difficult to cycle. I should‚Äôve kept it to the middle path. If I do this route again, I might even leave the bike at the start of the trees and just walk. It would mean crossing the burn at the ford, and risk getting wet at the start of the journey!\nBack on the reasonable path towards Derry Lodge, navigating the bog and mud again before crossing the bridge - that‚Äôs slightly too narrow to easily push my bike over! I was washing the mud off my wheels in the stream when the lady I‚Äôd met earlier was crossing the bridge! Seems like my estimate of 30 minutes extra for the Derry Cairngorm route was about right as that‚Äôs how long I was on the radio for, so good to know for next time.\n\n\n\nRoute down from Sron Riach\n\n\nThe cycle from Derry Lodge back to Linn of Dee car park is very easy, although I‚Äôd not be wanting to walk all that way! I was back home by 5pm, just in time to take the boys for their haircuts!\n\n\n\nRoute I took - 30km round trip and over 1,200m of cumulative ascent."

    "text": "Ski Centre\nI‚Äôve had my eye on this summit for a while. It‚Äôs 8 points for starters, and I‚Äôve been doing a lot of 1 pointers recently, but it‚Äôs quite the drive to get to, so whilst it doesn‚Äôt take long to climb, the total round trip is considerable. It‚Äôs also (just) over 1,000m high but the car park is at 670m, so the actual ascent is only 420m - very similar to some lower summits. Morven, a 4 point summit, was a 650m ascent!\nThe weather was sunny in Aberdeen when I left, and the forecast threaten rain later in the afternoon. I did my calculations and figured I‚Äôd be back in the car before the rain came. It‚Äôs only a 45-60 minute ascent.\nYou start in the upper car park at Glenshee ski centre, you can park right by the start of the track. The car park is ¬£4 which you pay for via a website, except in the valley there‚Äôs no 4G+, so you need to wait until you‚Äôre up the first slope and get signal again before you can pay. The alternative is stop in at the cafe and pay, but I‚Äôd already parked and wanted to get going.\nThe route is fairly straight forward in summer. The path is obvious, although it had a lot of loose gravel in many places. There are a few ups and downs along the way but nothing too bad. The steepest part is beyond the ski lift buildings on the final rise up to the main plateau. The path looks obvious from a distance but when you‚Äôre on it, it blends in with the terrain. Again, lots of loose stones here but a steady pace and I was at the top.\nIt‚Äôs still another 600m or so until you get to the actual summit, and I could see it being very easy to get lost in low cloud at this point, especially on the way back, it‚Äôs wide and featureless. Luckily the cloud wasn‚Äôt low, it was overcast but the view was still amazing, and on a clear day it must be spectacular.\nI met another walker sitting in the cairn having his lunch. We spoke for a bit and then I looked for somewhere else to setup. A bit further away there were two smaller piles of rocks I thought I could shelter behind. The wind was persistent and I needed my hood to keep my ears warm.\nI‚Äôve taken to just activating summits with VHF if I can, not that I don‚Äôt like doing HF, I just enjoy the simplicity of using a handheld and speaking to the locals. This is particularly the case if I don‚Äôt want to be sitting around for a long time, and whilst the rain‚Äôs arrival was forecast to be later still, I didn‚Äôt really want to hang around more than necessary. I setup the slim G on the carbon-6 pole and started calling CQ.\nI‚Äôd forgotten to spot, but I started on 145.500 MHz, the 2m calling frequency, and I‚Äôm used to 2m spotting not really helping. Stations started coming back to me from considerable distances, at least what I‚Äôm used to. Something I‚Äôm not used to is everyone asking to QSY to another frequency. The first caller who asked I sort of ignored his first request as I didn‚Äôt think it was necessary, but I did then move and we had a nice chat. I guess when there‚Äôs actually some activity or a big area it makes sense to move. I‚Äôve just used to the 4-6 people on 2m when I‚Äôm on the lower summits nearer Aberdeen that it doesn‚Äôt matter if we talk for 15 minutes on the calling frequency as there‚Äôs no-one else!\nMy furthest was 92 miles right across the west coast to GM4OAS. I was only a 31 for him but we managed. Had GM0USI/M driving on the A90 between Perth and Dundee, and then a guy walking his dog somewhere in East Lothian carrying his boafeng with him. He just had a rubber duck on, but his signal was strong with me, his audio was a bit muffled at times though. He gave his call as M7SGX, and so I was confused where he was, thinking he was in England. However, he‚Äôd just chosen to omit the RSL. Unless I misheard him several times!1\nI didn‚Äôt get anyone back in Aberdeen but I had 8 which was plenty. I did spot myself and called some more but that was it. I heard someone else but I think it was a repeater and my VFO B happened to be on its frequency but I didn‚Äôt have it programmed in (assume it was the Dundee one). As it happens I don‚Äôt think any of the repeaters in my D72 are correct, and I should add the others around Scotland.\nThe excitement of such far reaching FM contacts had kept me distracted from other walkers who were around and the cold wind. I looked up to see a few other people walking around, but no-one came to talk to me. I finished my lunch, debated about HF for a moment, but then decided I‚Äôd rather be getting home and packed up.\nThe walk down was trickier due to the scree patches and at one point I started marching off in the wrong direction as the path split. I could see the car park so I quickly realised the path wasn‚Äôt taking me down to it.\nNext time I think a yagi and a radio with 2m SSB!"

This route isn‚Äôt the greatest, and was only picked for it‚Äôs short duration and short drive to the starting point. It starts out easy enough following the track and then crossing the field. It briefly follows a path that you could take the whole way up to the top, just a little longer. You have to jump the Fergus Burn, but it‚Äôs quite small in places, and then you start the slog straight up the hill to the summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the sleeting on the way down from Monamenach, the sky was even clearer now, and I had good views back and forwards of my hills for the day.\nWhilst the walk up was steep enough, it went by quickly and I was soon leaning into the wind on the summit. There wasn‚Äôt much shelter by the trig point, and the top hole was covered, but I did find the mast mount which happened to be behind a slight rise, so that offered as little relief. Making full use of the post, I felt very smart when I took this photo.\n\n\n\nLovely station\n\n\nand then this‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nSad pole\n\n\nAt that moment it was very obvious that I should‚Äôve attached the mast on the leeward side of the support, so the metal post didn‚Äôt act like my leg when I break sticks over it. ü§¶\n\nI collapsed the mast enough to get past the break and continued on 2m. Three repeat stations from the first summit, and another got it qualified and then I was ‚Äúhappy‚Äù to pack up and grump down the hillside back to the car. Luckily, I had packed a spare mast in the car.\n\nOn to the next hill!"

    "text": "After the lovely weekend‚Äôs weather, I was watching the forecast and today‚Äôs was looking good, so I decided to take the day off work and go for a big trip in the Cairngorms. Unfortunately, by the time it got to today, the weather wasn‚Äôt quite as nice as originally forecast. It was mild though, 12 degC at the Linn of Dee when I set off in the morning.\n\n\n\nCycle through the forest\n\n\n\n\n\nPath to Derry Lodge, Carn a Mhaim in the clouds at the back\n\n\nI started at Linn of Dee, and cycled along the nice track to Derry Lodge, a now boarded up hunting lodge. It‚Äôs common for people to leave their bikes here as the paths beyond aren‚Äôt quite as nice, or people are doing the big loop around Derry Cairngorm, Ben Macdui and back, and this is where all the paths return to. My route today did have a loop but not as big, and I continued to cycle on to Luibeg burn.\n\n\n\nDerry Lodge Bridge\n\n\nAfter crossing the bridge, the ground soon beomes very muddy and boggy, with the bike wheels disappearing half way into the mud. It was hard work finding a path across, but once that was done the track was reasonable again. There were some surface drains across the path but they were wide and easy to cycle over, but as I neared Luibed these became more rocky and less navigable whilst cycling. I reached Luibeg and wanted to leave my bike near the bridge, as this would be where I‚Äôd be coming on the way back.\n\n\n\nLuibeg Bridge - I was approaching from the right and heading to the left on this map\n\n\nThere are actually three routes from east to west from when you meet the trees at Luibeg. I‚Äôd planned to take the upper route, ended up on the lower route, and found that the middle one would‚Äôve been best! I ended up trying to get my bike through the woods on a tiny track, with rocks and roots and all sorts. It was not easy, but I eventually made it to the bridge. I left my bike there, crossed the bridge and walked down to rejoin the path before taking the northern split to ascent Carn a Mhaim. As I was walking up I realised I‚Äôd lost my LoRa tracker somewhere in those woods. It was on the top of my bag and the trees must‚Äôve knocked it off. üò¢ It wasn‚Äôt on as there are no igates nearby and I‚Äôm in the valley, so it‚Äôs not like I can even track the tracker!\n\n\n\nLuibeg Bridge - the alternative to fording the burn\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking back the way I came along Glen Lui\n\n\nAs I climbed I entered the cloud and the lovely views all disappeared. The walk up was steep but straightforward.\n\n\n\nIn the cloud\n\n\nThen out of the mist the summit cairn appeared and I setup for my first activation of the day. I‚Äôd hoped to qualify the summit on 2m, so I could get moving, but being mid-week I wasn‚Äôt hopeful. I did get three 2m QSOs fairly quickly, and then set up the quick 5.5m vertical for 20m. Contacts came in quick with that and then I thought I heard Bill, GM0NRT, call on 20m but I think it was on the HT still and then in my confusion the chasers stopped. However, I had enough contacts so just packed up. As I was doing so, Denis, MM0CBC, was out on a summit further west near Aviemore and he‚Äôd just reached the top. We had a tricky QSO as Bill thought I was speaking to him still on 2m, he struggled to hear me but heard me asking Denis to QSY, again thinking it was me asking Bill to QSY! Denis couldn‚Äôt hear Bill so it was probably confusing for him too but we made it in the end. As I was chatting with Denis, a lady came by to the summit. She was curious as to what I was doing and we had a brief chat. She then left and continued up to Ben Macdui. I packed up and started towards it myself.\n\n\n\nAt the summit\n\n\n\n\n\nStation setup\n\n\nThe path that continues towards Ben Macdui follows the ridge between the two glens until it gets to the side of the mountain. This is quite a narrow ridge, but thankfully the wind was gentle. The clouds did start to part and I had a few glimpses down into Lairig Ghru, including Corrour bothy at the foot of Cairn Toul and Devil‚Äôs Point climb.\n\n\n\nCorrour Bothy\n\n\n\n\n\nRidge to Ben Macdui\n\n\nThen on to Ben Macdui!"

    "text": "The 145 Alive! event was planned for today between 1-3pm, which I wanted to join in with. Should be the perfect time to activate a summit on 2m! I had the three little kids with me for the day, so it had to be a easy summit. Particularly as I wanted to bring up the tent and lunch and things for them, to keep them entertained whilst I was on the air. The previous times I‚Äôve brought them, I‚Äôve only been about 20 minutes at most and trying to go much longer would be tricky. Eventually I want to qualify all the GM/ES summits, and so Waughton hill is on my list. It‚Äôs quite out of the way with nothing else nearby, so it‚Äôs a trip in itself and for one point, I‚Äôm not wasting a day off on it! It‚Äôs also the lowest summit in GM/ES, and seemed perfect for our adventure.\n\n\n\nWhite Horse\n\n\nThe path up is short, although does cross a field full of cows, and you soon find yourself by the white horse. Walk by its head and you‚Äôre on the top of the rise, and heading towards the old hunter‚Äôs cottage. The actual summit is a bit further away, requiring you to go down and up the side of the hill again. However, the hunter‚Äôs cottage is in the activation zone and the kids thought we‚Äôd reached the top and started playing in the house. There was also a nice piece of grass without any sheep or animal droppings on it for the tent I‚Äôd brought. The tent and mast went up easily enough and lunch and various toys were unloaded into the tent. It was about 12:55 and I wanted to be on the air for the start of the event, so I swallowed down my rolls and setup the IC-705. Turns out the coax on the slim G with the 6m tactical mini mast is just a little too short for the radio to be on the ground. I usually don‚Äôt notice as either using the carbon 6, where the antenna sits a little lower on it, or a HT which I‚Äôm holding at standing height. So I ended up having to hold the 705 in my hand the whole time.\n\n\n\nStation setup\n\n\nI‚Äôve not long had the IC-705 and whilst it is very simple to use, sometimes I get into some modes or settings that I don‚Äôt know how to get out of. Today I was already on 2m FM but would the VFO change the frequency? No.¬†First I was worried I‚Äôd bashed it in my bag and the dial was broken, then thought perhaps I‚Äôd selected 10 or 100 Hz increment but that didn‚Äôt seem to matter. I ended up just pressing stuff and then going to band and choosing 144 MHz again seemed to fix it. Phew!\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nIt was nice having the waterfall to see is there was any activity and there certainly was some! I knew MM0EFI and MM0RFN were going up Ben Macdui and Glas Maol respectively, but not sure if they‚Äôd got to the summit in time. Fraser was supposed to be on 145.250, so I tuned to it and heard Bill, GM0NRT, talking to someone but couldn‚Äôt hear the other end. I was worried I couldn‚Äôt hear Fraser on Ben Macdui, but turned out was just someone else. Tuning around, I heard a guy down at the car park by Hill of Garvock and ended up qualifying the summit with those on his net. I managed to work four summit to summits, two on Ben Macdui, Glas Maol and then Morven. I heard a station down in East Lothian calling on 145.500 but he didn‚Äôt hear my reply. After about an hour, I had 10 QSOs and thought it was about time we packed up.\n\n\n\nOff to Aden Country Park\n\n\nWe headed back down, and went to Aden Country Park for some more fun. Turned out to be an old timey tractor fair and there were loads of them on the roads as we drove there.\nWas a fun day all round, and nice to join in with this event. Maybe next time I‚Äôll try for a higher summit!\nThe guys up Ben Macdui had a fun trip.. Not jealous in the slightest‚Ä¶üòÖ Also afterwards, Chris, 2M0RVZ, was boasting about his points compared to mine‚Ä¶challenge accepted!"

    "text": "Tim, GM5OLD, is up in the area and doing a few summits. I took the opportunity (with kind support from the family‚Ä¶for the morning at least!) to be out at the same time for some S2S action. Tim was going up both Mona Gowan and Morven today, and so I picked a 4-pointer nearby - the very Scottish sounding, Brown Cow Hill.\n\n\n\nCorgarff Castle\n\n\nThe route starts in the car park for Corgarff castle and takes a nice track up the hill. Weather was okay, some low cloud and the possibility of rain in the afternoon. Our rendezvous time was around 10-10:30am. After my previous epic journey up two high peaks, this felt like a walk in the park. There was almost no wind and that alone made it enjoyable.\n\n\n\nWatchers\n\n\nI soon entered the cloud and visibility dropped considerably. This was fine whilst I was following the track but after a while it mostly disappears into the heather‚Ä¶and peat hags.\n\n\n\nMist\n\n\n\n\n\nPeat hags\n\n\n\n\n\nand more peat hags\n\n\nThere must‚Äôve been some serious water coming down as the channels carved by it were huge, I had to make quite a few detours to find crossable areas without having to scramble down a muddy cliff face. It was wet and boggy underfoot, and I had plenty of full foot submersions.\n\n\n\nNew fence\n\n\nNear the top, I emerged from the cloud and could enjoy some of the scenery again. A very new looking fence seemed to cross across the path but luckily a gate was nearby, so I didn‚Äôt have to clamber over it. Being out of the mist, I was rewarded with some lovely views across to nearby summits, including Ben Avon I recently did. There wasn‚Äôt any snow at the top of them any more, they were out of the cloud and probably enjoyed the minimal wind as I was. Today would‚Äôve been a much better day to climb them! If I did have the whole day, it would‚Äôve been good to try Ben Macdui or some of the other high peaks too.\n\n\n\nCulardoch to the south\n\n\n\n\n\nA sunny summit - not sure which, Morrone?\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Avon and Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird (perhaps South Top)\n\n\nI reached the summit about 10am and setup my mast with the slim G and sloper L random wire antenna. The complete lack of wind was so enjoyable, although I still managed not to fully extend the mast and it collapsed on me! I knew Tim was nearly at the top too, so once setup I just listened to the bands and had something to eat. Unfortunately, just at the moment the cloud came in and the lovely views disappeared - oh well!\n\n\n\nNot much of a cairn\n\n\n\n\n\nStation setup\n\n\nI brought the G90 and 4Ah LiFePO4 battery today. I like the G90, it‚Äôs a bit heavier than the KX2, but as my first radio, I have a soft spot for it. It‚Äôs pretty capable, especially given the price, and 20W and a tuner than can match the 5.5m vertical random wire on 40m is pretty sweet. 20W over 10W probably makes no discernible difference, but I do like the little waterfall for finding quiet spots on the band. If I‚Äôm going on a long walk, and multiple summits, I‚Äôd probably stick with the KX2. If the weather is bad, I‚Äôd lean more to the KX2 also, as its form factor makes it easier to keep hidden from the rain in my shadow or a plastic bag. However, on a short walk, and nice weather, I‚Äôd probably take the G90, or if I just want a change.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nI had some nice QSOs with Tim, GM5OLD, Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ, on 2m. I could hear Bill, GM0NRT, in Aberdeen about a 31, but he couldn‚Äôt hear me. Tim had Bill as a 59, but it seemed Mona Gowan/Morven were enough to block my signal. Tim and I had a nice chat for a while, on 145.500, but there‚Äôs no-one around here so it doesn‚Äôt matter üòÖ, and then we both went to HF. Plenty of contacts on 40m, in England, Ireland and into Europe. I hunted a few summit to summits, with a pair in Italy and one in Norway. I moved up to 10m, a band I‚Äôve not tried much, usually as I‚Äôm in a rush and once the summit is qualified I‚Äôm off, and got several more stations in Europe and a couple into ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù, the Canary Islands, receiving 55 and 59 from them.\n\n\n\nViews to the north\n\n\nI was meant to be home by 1pm but I was having a blast on the air, and the weather was pleasant, so I ended up staying at the summit for much longer than I planned. However, I did have to get back, so I packed up and headed down. I tried walking a straight route from crossing the fence back to the main track, but managed to wind all over the place. There did seem to be fewer peat hags on the way back, although the few that there were, they were a lot steeper. I also managed to miss the turning on the track back to the castle and looked up to find the castle much higher than me, so then scrambled up the side of the slope to get back on the proper track. At this point it started to rain a little but I was nearly back to the car.\nI‚Äôm only the 8th person to activate Brown Cow Hill. It‚Äôs clearly not a popular summit, and likely one for just those looking to complete GM/ES or other lists. There are plenty of other ones nearby that are more appealing. However, if the weather is clear, you get some stunning views all around, and the walk up isn‚Äôt that bad - around 6.6 km and 425m ascent, with minimal ups and downs - just the peat hags to deal with but other summits have those too. I still stand by that Morven is the worst summit for brutality of ascent!\nHere‚Äôs Fraser at the other end of our 2m QSO."

I looked back over to Mheadoin and, typically, now it was in the sun too!\n\n\n\nAcross to Chaorainn\n\n\n\n\n\nüåà\n\n\n\n\n\nBeinn Mheadoin in the sun\n\n\nThe climb up Beinn a‚ÄôChaorainn starts quite steep with loose gravel but soon turns into a nice climb, aside from the boulder patch, but you can mostly work around it. As I got higher the wind picked up again. The summit cairn didn‚Äôt look very impressive, but actually offered decent shelter and I was quite comfortable behind it.\n\n\n\nAt the summit\n\n\n\n\n\nStation (in the process of being dismantled!)\n\n\nThis time I tried 20m and the band was much more enjoyable, with a strong signal everywhere between south of England and Greece around 1,700 miles away.\nDenis, MM0CBC on holiday from Wales, was on his way up Ben Tinnes, GM/ES-021, and by the time I was done with HF he was just setting up there, so we had a nice 2m S2S.\nIt was 1345 and I really needed to be back at Linn of Dee by 1530, to get home in time, so after getting distracted taking more photos, I hot stepped it back down and retrieved my bike. A reasonable number of other cyclists and hikers out, I didn‚Äôt meet any on the summits but along the main routes. It seemed now was the best weather of the day and plnety to enjoy as I cycled back.\n\n\n\nSun shining on Beinn Mheadoin\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking back up the Glen - Beinn Mheadoin at the back\n\n\nBack at Linn of Dee at exactly 1530, and then the 1.5 hours drive back to Aberdeen. There was a huge moon and the road back to Braemar offered some lovely views of the moon between the trees and hills, together with the start of the sunsetting, my potato photo doesn‚Äôt do it justice.\n\n\n\nBig moon\n\n\nAnother big trip, probably the last of this year, unless there‚Äôs a December heat wave, and two infrequently visited and activated summits. It‚Äôs hard not to be biased by the weather but Beinn a‚ÄôChaorainn was my favourite today. When the clouds cleared I could see over to Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird area, down to Beinn Bhreac and big sweeping expanses of hillsides. It would‚Äôve been nice to have been on Beinn Mheadhoin when the cloud lifted to see across to the west, and probably that would‚Äôve been more spectacular. I‚Äôll be revisiting them both next year, hopefully finding a day with clear blue skies! üåû\nAlso posted on the reflector."

    "text": "After a lovely day yesterday on Lochnagar and Conachcraig, I was looking to see where I could go today. There was a swimming competition on, in addition to the usual activities, so I needed to be back for 3pm. Last week when I was on An Socach, the others went to Carn a‚ÄôGheoidh, and I remembered them leaving later than me but arriving at the top at the same time. Sure enough when I check all the times, it looked doable to get there and back in time. The longest part is the drive to Glenshee ski centre, and that‚Äôs right at the limit of the electric car - returning home with 20 miles range still makes me a little nervous!\n\n\n\nA grey day\n\n\nThe weather forecast had it cloudy with chance of showers and reasonably breezy. It did rain a little on the way out but was dry when I arrived. I wasted about 10 minutes getting a parking ticket from the cafe - I should‚Äôve just opened the link in the car park when I was up the hill and had signal, like I did with Glas Maol.\n\n\n\nLook, snow!\n\n\nThe track follows up the ski maintenance tracks, which are quite steep to start. There‚Äôs a shortcut across part way up which I just walked right past. My Inreach mini started beeping as I‚Äôd gone of course and so I backtracked and found it. It was a small track at right angles to the main path just behind a fence, so not too obvious, so thanks to the Garmin!\n\n\n\nNavigation via Inreach Mini\n\n\nI was soon in the cloud and did check on the inreach every so often to make sure I was heading in the right direction. I doesn‚Äôt have topo maps, and just a line but it has a compass and so points in the right direction and is enough to make sure you‚Äôre following the right path.\n\n\n\nCloudy\n\n\nI didn‚Äôt see much on the way up, other than about 20m around me, mostly looking like the photo. In exposed places the wind picked up a lot and gave me a good push. At one point I was about 3m from a small loch and I didn‚Äôt realise until I was right upon it. The track was decent and only in a few places was it boggy but nothing like The Buck. The final ascent to the summit is steep again after a while of walking on the mostly flat plateau. At this point the wind was howling and I was glad there was a cairn at the top.\n\n\n\nMade it!\n\n\nI setup behind the cairn, which was a very good shelter from the wind, had a sandwich and then got on the air. I thought I‚Äôd try a bit more power on 2m and see if I could get any further than usual. I‚Äôd brought the Kenwood V71 and battery. This is the first time I‚Äôve taken it out with me, and I also haven‚Äôt used it much at home, so I was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt get into any operating issues with it! I had the slim G, and was glad I hadn‚Äôt brought the yagi to try and setup in the wind.\n\n\n\nWind battered carbon mast\n\n\n\n\n\nKenwood V71, trying to keep dry\n\n\nI now wonder if I‚Äôd setup the mast on the outside of the cairn pointing into the wind, if I could‚Äôve made it more vertical. Particularly as right at the end the antenna got blown off and I ended up holding it with my arm to finish the QSO - I didn‚Äôt do an EMF assessment on that setup‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nIt was a little slow to start, but eventually I‚Äôd work 9 stations, including GM4OAS 90 miles to the west in Mallaig. I did find the lowest squelch on the V71 was quite high and not breaking for several stations. I eventually turned it off and then heard several locals and others. I do wonder how many had been replying to my CQs before. Did 50W make any difference? The map looks remarkably similar to when I was on Glas Maol, and that was with the 5W D72 handheld. Technically, it‚Äôs 10 dB which is 1.x S points, and on Glas Maol GM4OAS gave me 32 and this time he gave me 42, so whilst not more power, I was readable more? I do like the form factor of using the mobile rig with the fist mic, means I can position things easier than being tied directly to the end of the mast, but probably for the most part it makes no real difference and it‚Äôs all in my head!\n\n\n\nCloud clearing‚Ä¶for a moment\n\n\nKeeping an eye on the time, I needed to pack up and head back. The wind was still relentless and on the top I had to lean into it. I was grateful of my big hood as I followed the path back down. It‚Äôs amazing how you can forget some of the details of the walk on the way back, being surprised that I had to climb up and down a few places which I didn‚Äôt remember on the way up to the summit! For a few moments the wind seemed to blow the clouds away and there was even a hint of sunshine coming through. The view opened up and I could see all around. Certainly not the spectacular views of last week, but enjoyable for the few moments. Back down to the car and back home.\n\n\n\nLift to the clouds\n\n\nI think this summit and Glas Maol would make a nice day trip out, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with the option of a hot lunch at the ski centre cafe. For 6 and 8 pointers, they have fairly easy and short walks, and both great locations for 2m, particularly to the south. Doing both would be 14 points, and a lot less walking and climbing than my 14 point day yesterday on Lochnagar and Conachcraig!"

Monday or Tuesday were better days but alas I couldn‚Äôt make that happen. As you can see the forecast was meant to be lovely clear skies and maybe some cloud creeping in later. Well it was the opposite, with the best weather as I was cycling back‚Ä¶oh well. Here we go:\n\n\n\nRoute for the day. Light blue section is mostly cycling.\n\n\nLast week I did GM/ES-001 and GM/ES-013 on a big bike and hike, and today would be similar. I had debated between Cairn Toul + Braeriach and the two summits today, but everyone told me Cairn Toul circuit was too much, and save that for a summer‚Äôs day (or maybe camp in the Corrour bothy at the bottom). They‚Äôd all done the route so I should probably listen‚Ä¶and eventually I did. I‚Äôm glad, because it would‚Äôve been too long, and the weather wasn‚Äôt the best - particularly the wind - and so that wouldn‚Äôt have been enjoyable.\n\n\n\nCrossing Lui Water\n\n\n\n\n\nBridge at Derry Lodge\n\n\nStarting at Linn of Dee car park, around 0830, I cycled on the nice track to Derry Lodge. Here my route would take me east following the Derry Burn up Glen Derry. This section of the track is not great for cycling on, lots of roots, rocks, narrow sections with overhanging heather. It was slow going, much slower than I planned. Once you get to the next bridge and a few 10s metres along it‚Äôs much better. Some maps show an ATV track that runs somewhat parallel to this route. I didn‚Äôt see the start of it, but wondered if it would be better. Near the bridge you see it, and I did try it on the way back but it was very boggy, muddy and wet, and quick to disappear, so I just stuck to what I knew. The return run is less bad, as at least you‚Äôre generally going downhill.\n\n\n\nThis is not the path to cycle\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking up Derry Glen to the summits\n\n\nThe cycling continues along the track, and once you pass the final wooded area it starts to become rocky and difficult again. I started pushing my bike through the bad sections but they just became more and more, and it wouldn‚Äôt save time as I‚Äôd have to push it on the way back. So I dumped the bike in the heather and continued up to the Y junction.\n\n\n\nBike left here\n\n\nIt was about 09:40, so 1-1:10 of cycling. My route was left at the Y, following the Coire Etchachan burn, past Hutchison Memorial hut and to the shores of little loch Etchachan.\n\n\n\nFootbridge over Coire Etchachan burn\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to the loch, bothy on the left\n\n\nI had a peak inside the bothy and looked through the visitors book. Always interesting the little odds and ends people have left for others. Actually my first time in a bothy, would be fun one time‚Ä¶as long as I remembered to bring firewood!\n\n\n\nBothy\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial Plaque\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the bothy\n\n\nNow the climb really started, and this brought the wind with it. It was relentless, reaching the peak at the top by the Loch.\nI‚Äôd hoped the wind was just strong in the valley, and coming off the loch and that the summit would be better. Perhaps hoping in vain of course. The weather was not the clear skies forecast but very grey clouds, that I was about to be walking through. Not sure if it was raining or the wind just pushing huge volumes of air against me and the resultant water condensing made it seem like it was raining, but I was pretty wet all over.\n\n\n\nArriving at the lochs\n\n\n\n\n\nPath up to Beinn Mheadhoin\n\n\nEventually a tor appeared out of the cloud and I thought I‚Äôd made it‚Ä¶looking at my map I realised it wasn‚Äôt and I still had some way to go. The next one appeared and I climbed up on top, but that was pushing it in the wind, and so I decided not to climb anymore. I thought the tors would shelter me from the wind but it seemed to come around from every direction and there was nowhere sheltered. I setup the mast and long wire, as I planned to start with 40m. I had the wrong guy ring for the carbon 6 and so it kept sliding all the way down, plus the peg into the wind kept lifting. I ended up putting three of the guys into the wind, plus pegging down the wire into the wind and it reached some equilibrium and held in place. It did remind me of the wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúEnjoying it‚Äù\n\n\n40m wasn‚Äôt great, lots of QSB and I didn‚Äôt hang around long. Time for summit #2. Packed up and headed down into the Lairig an Laoigh. The sun was starting to peak through and once I was on the descent the wind abated. I took quite a direct route down, which was very steep and probably not the best route, although not sure where would‚Äôve been better.\nRead on for Beinn a‚ÄôChaorainn.\nAlso posted on the SOTA reflector. Following the discussion there, it turns out my route from Derry Lodge was not the best one when cycling. In fact, not crossing the Derry Burn at the lodge and continuing on the east side until I got to the foot bridge would‚Äôve been a better cycle path - oh well, I know for next time!"

Once someone posts a spot it‚Äôs pretty quick for them to get a pile up. I‚Äôve kept thinking about doing it, and I do live in an ideal place where there are plenty of summits to chose from. I‚Äôve not been on the radio much this year and I ended up taking a day off today to drop off and pick up the kids from school, so I decided I should make the most of it and go up a mountain!\nUsing the great SOTA map website, Sotlas, I had a look around to see where I should go first. As I was doing the school run, I was limited on time to about 6 hours all in. I also thought I shouldn‚Äôt try too much on my first attempt, in both walking and radio setup. I noticed that some summits get bonus points during the winter (between about December and March), and one of those was near me so I thought that would be ideal. The place is called Bennachie, and one of its highest peaks is Oxen Craig. The peaks are call a ‚Äòtap‚Äô. This is the summit GM/ES-061, which is worth two points and five in the winter.\nAs you can see from this photo taken by MM7MWL, it‚Äôs a beautiful view."

I use it when out in the garden, but have never had to carry it very far. I do have a few 18650 lithium cells which I‚Äôm meaning to make my own portable battery but I‚Äôve not got round to it yet. So the ultramax had to do.\nI also brought my Boafeng 2m/70cm radio to try some 2m FM. I have a Kenwood TH-D72, which I thought of bringing for APRS, but it‚Äôs too complex for my liking.

    "text": "The Activation\nWith the kids dropped off at school, and backpack packed, I set off about 0915 to drive to the car park behind the summit.\n\n\n\nAt the car park\n\n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure how long everything was going to take, so I opted to find the shortest and most direct route to the summit. There are quite a few walks you can do in the area via various taps and approach from different sides, but starting at the ‚Äúback‚Äù looked the quickest. It was basically a straight up.\nI had looked at doing two activations in one trip, as Millstone Hill, GM/ES-077, isn‚Äôt that far away. However, when I worked out a couple of routes they were 4-5 hours of walking and I decided that was trying to do too much in one day.\n\n\n\nRoute planned on OS Maps\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight up 350m over 2.2km (or 1,150 ft over 1.4 miles)\n\n\nI paid my parking at 0953, and was being blown away on the summit by 1040, which was a bit quicker than the 1:08 hrs OSMaps suggested it would take to walk up. I was pretty hot and sweaty by the time I got to the top, and had taken off my hat, but once exposed in the wind, I was glad to have it.\n\n\n\nLooking North\n\n\n\n\n\nUp we go\n\n\n\nIt was quite nice weather on the way up, I could see the summits were under cloud cover, and when I reached the top the wind was howling and the air was very cold.\n\n\n\nCloud\n\n\n\n\n\nView from the top\n\n\nI looked around for a nice place to setup, and ate my sandwich. Another guy came up and we said hello. I tried a few calls on 145.500 MHz, but I think I would‚Äôve needed to organise this ahead of time with the locals. I found a nice outcrop to shelter behind that was in front of the summit, and setup the pole and radio on a rock. I had a little nook to crouch in and there I started to see if I could make any contacts.\n\n\n\nRadio Setup\n\n\nI started on 40m, had a listen to 10m, but it seemed dead, then moved to 15m and then finally 20m. I managed 37 contacts, with 14 countries, two summit to summit QSOs, and one parks on the air contact. My furthest contact was with Z36T in The Republic of North Macedonia at 1501 miles.\n\n\n\nMap (partial) from SOTA database\n\n\nI‚Äôd been on the air 50 minutes and my logging hand was getting cold! Plus I was getting stiff in my funny crouching position, and concious of getting back in time to pick up the kids. I was using Cloudlogoffline app to log, which is handy as it can then sync to my cloudlog database but I don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt keep the frequency from the previous QSO as the default entry. [update: you can under the settings, so set it there before starting to add QSOs.] It‚Äôs also fiddly to add another SOTA reference due to the iOS keyboard coming up when you select an input box and not being able to scroll. I might just do ‚ÄòFast Log Entry‚Äô (FLE) next time in an Apple note file. I‚Äôll see what else there is too. VK port-a-log seems to be a favourite for SOTA but it‚Äôs Android only.\nI was back in time for a nice cup of tea and sit down before it was school pick up. I look forward to the next one. It‚Äôs fun being the DX! üìª‚õ∞Ô∏è"

The weather was absolutely lovely, although the forecast for the summit was high winds.\n\n\n\nClachnaben view from the start\n\n\nThe route was a long cycle, around 1:30, including pushing it up much of the steep parts to have a quick journey home. The path is very well made up the whole way, but you just have to watch you take the right turns at a few locations.\n\n\n\nWas it left or right?\n\n\n\nI dropped my bike at the turn off to the summit. As I approached the summit the wind was picking up considerably, I could also smell and see a lot of smoke in the air. Seemed to be some fires to the south, but at times the wind would blow great clouds of it towards me and it were as if I was right to a bonfire.\n\n\n\nFires\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking north with view of path from the summit\n\n\nThis is a good summit for 2m, I think Fraser has done a 145 Alive event from here, and from looking at past logs on sotlas, so I was hoping for a quick activation on 2m. It wasn‚Äôt quite as quick as I‚Äôd hoped, but also turned out my spot didn‚Äôt really work properly, and showed as Test, due to the changes to the SOTA API and SOTAGoat not being updated.\n\n\n\nAt the top, in the wind!\n\n\nHowever, my first CQ, with just the RH-770 telescopic antenna on, was immediately replied by G6BIA from South Shields, outside Newcastle, at 235 km/146 miles away! Great signal! It took another 30 minutes to get the 3 more needed to qualify and then one more from Hibby, MM0RFN, who met Fraser, MM0EFI, for lunch in Westhill.\n\nSome good shelter on the summit - thank goodness - but also lots of fences and posts for future antenna mounting options! A good summit to spend the day if the weather co-operates.\n\n\n\nSlim G in the air\n\n\nDescent was quick, thanks to pushing the bike up so much of the ascent. Some parts were a bit hairy - steep, loose gravel and gusty winds, but once I was a little lower it was some nice free wheeling much of the way. It‚Äôs also a nice close summit, only being about 30 minutes drive from my house.\n\n\n\nMore views from the top"

It really only got better when climbing to the final top.\n\n\n\nSummit in the distance\n\n\n\n\n\nFallen tree on the path\n\n\nThe final section of the walk doesn‚Äôt really have a path up to the summit, the track just continues around the hill and away, so it was a case of scrambling up the heather and trying to avoid the streams coming down. It was cold but still on the way up, but as soon as I was on the summit the wind was strong. I found a low spot with a post and some shelter and setup on 20m there.

    "text": "After my first summit, I was keen to go again. I didn‚Äôt get much opportunity for a few weeks but then one Friday I was off work and it was a glorious day so it seemed like the perfect opportunity. The route in Sotlas was the one I took. There‚Äôs a small car park at the start of the route near Knockburn Loch - a favourite place for paddle boarding and other lake activities. The start is a dirt road that the loggers and farmers use and so an easy walk gently uphill.\n\n\n\nView of the summit from the road\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn right here! ‚û°Ô∏è\n\n\nOnce you start getting into the forest part you turn off the road and onto a track. The weather had been quite wet and there was evidence of run off washing away a lot of the path up. It was like walking on a dry river bed!\n\n\n\nPath or river bed?\n\n\nThe gradient picks up in the forest area and then you emerge around 400m up looking up to the summit and across to the south, where there‚Äôs a wind farm on the side of the hill. The walk from here continues up and round to the summit. I had blue skies and a bit of haze in the distance but great views all round.\n\n\n\nWindfarm\n\n\n\n\n\nNot far to the top\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking East\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the summit\n\n\nThis time I had a much lighter pack with me. I‚Äôd been lucky in find a used KX2, and it is considerably lighter than my G90 plus huge battery! I have it tucked into a little LowePro camera case and I printed a front cover to protect it whilst in transit. I was using the short random wire vertical as before. This is a 5.5m radiator, with two 4.25m counterpoises. They‚Äôre attached via bananaplugs to a BNC, then a short piece of coax with a common mode choke into the radio. I also had my Boafeng for 2m FM.\n\n\n\nEssentials\n\n\nI got 3 on 2m FM from Aberdeen and shire, then setup on HF. Where the G90 can tune the antenna on 40m, the KX2 can‚Äôt - not without a helper transformer. So I went straight to 20m, where I managed another 10 contacts. The highlight being JW9DSA from Svalbard. I didn‚Äôt know where JW was at the time and he was a very strong signal, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. He did keep saying ‚Äúhello from the artic‚Äù, and thanking me for the SOTA activation. I sort of assumed it was Russian somewhere. When I got home I looked him up and saw where and what they were up to! He wasn‚Äôt on a summit at the time, just in the camp calling others. A good contact at around 1,500 miles, and makes the map look bigger!\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nI‚Äôd also tried out the tiny mic for the first time. I assumed it worked okay as no-one said anything untowards. I also had the audio repeat (I forget the proper term), so I could hear myself and it seemed fine to me also. It was back down and back home. I was hot by the time I got back as the weather was warm and it was sunny. Had a nice cup of tea at home, looked at the logs and then it was time to pick the kids up from school!\n\n\n\nTiny Mic in action\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward to the next one!"

    "text": "After hearing that Alan, MM0VPM, was doing a tour of the Cairngorms, the local SOTA group was listening out for him. I commented that no one had done Beinn Bhrotain for a long time, not even Fraser. His response was, ‚ÄúHow about Sunday, then?‚Äù The offer included transportation and a loan of a mountain bike, plus, of course, the guided tour‚Äîan offer too good to refuse! Free time on the weekends can be tricky, with several sets of kids‚Äô activities and potential birthday parties, so we needed to start early so I could be back in time for my wife to start her coaching session at the swim club. Fraser was good with that, and our rendezvous was at 6 a.m. in the Dinnet car park for the onward journey to the Linn of Dee.\n\n\n\nReady to Ride!\n\n\nWe‚Äôd all seen a photo recently shared of the midge in the area, which is quite unusual away from the west of Scotland. Sure enough, there were plenty about when we arrived and unpacked the bikes. We met a DoE group packing up their tents at White Bridge, and they told tales of woe and suffering in the evening; the leader seemed very pleased to be going home. My wife later told me about one of her swimmers sending home a photo of a pan of custard he was cooking on his expedition, which had a nice layer of midges on top. ü§¢\n\n\n\nAlong the Dee, summit in the clouds\n\n\n\n\n\nThey‚Äôre deeper than they look\n\n\nThe weather was pleasant enough, although the promised clear skies had yet to appear, and the cloud level was fairly low. We continued on our ride, following the Dee along a rockier track with plenty of culverts to negotiate. After around 7.5 km of cycling, we left the bikes by the side of the fence and took the track up towards the first summit we could just about see, Carn Cloich-mhuilinn. The path came and went, or we found and lost it several times, but with the rocky peak to aim for, it wasn‚Äôt too difficult to navigate. Every so often, Fraser would point out surrounding summits or features, complete with name, SOTA points, and YouTube URL, the names of which I‚Äôd immediately forget until he told them to me again on the way back down. The last 200m or so climb of this Carn was bouldery but nice underfoot, a bit like clambering across rocks at a beach. With the interim summit climbed, we admired the view. The cloud was still low, and a few patches of sun were appearing in the distance. It looked promising that it would clear for us, although I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would in time for our final ascent.\n\n\n\nPath to the summit\n\n\n\n\n\nView back towards the Dee\n\n\nWe had a good view across a small gully where the path was as obvious as could be. After a short descent down to a wee stream, the path was lost to us. A few phantom paths appeared, and we followed them, probably veering more towards the west than necessary, but we found a way. I kept my eye on SOTAGoat, to be sure I wasn‚Äôt being led astray, and we soon found ourselves both within the activation zone and the cloud. The trig appeared out of the mist, and we had made it!\n\n\n\nThe summit, with LoRa beaconing (to no-one ‚òπÔ∏è)\n\n\nHaving eaten breakfast in Aberdeen at 5 a.m., it now felt like lunchtime, even though it was only around 09:15. At this point, I found out one of Fraser‚Äôs secrets to successful mountaineering ‚Äî butteries. Claiming ‚Äúthis was all he could find in the cupboard,‚Äù he proceeded to eat what I‚Äôd estimate to be around 8,000 calories in a matter of minutes. Checking the schedule, we decided we had around 45 minutes on the summit before we should head back down.\nFraser had brought the FT-857 and his 100g yagi, and was hopeful to activate on 2m. I was on HF with the KX2 and the 18ft (5.5m) random wire vertical. We each found a suitable pile of rocks to shelter behind and set to work.\n\n\n\nSetting up yagi\n\n\n\n\n\nA brief spell of sun\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking the south\n\n\nI started on 40m; the antenna needs a transformer to get a match, and even though it‚Äôs short, I‚Äôve made contacts this way before. I thought I‚Äôd try 40m, as maybe it‚Äôs a desirable trig point or WAB etc., place that folks would want. I could hear some contest callers, but after my spot and calling with no replies, it was clearly completely dead for me, so I moved to 20m. After spotting and calling CQ, a slow trickle of replies came, and I relaxed once I crossed number 4! The replies kept coming, including four summit-to-summit stations in Germany, Switzerland, and Romania. I considered some other bands, but time was marching on, my hands were cold, and everything was getting wet. The sun suddenly shone through for a few moments, and it looked lovely. Two runners then came by, having climbed from the opposite side. They asked what I was doing, to which my usual answer is ‚Äúamateur radio, speaking to other people on mountains.‚Äù They were impressed with Switzerland and asked if I could say hi from them. They soon ran off again, and given they were in running shorts and vests, I‚Äôm not surprised they didn‚Äôt want to hang around.\n\n\n\nCarbon 6 and 5.5 m vertical\n\n\n\n\n\nActivation attire\n\n\n\n\n\nMy QSOs on 20m\n\n\nI could hear Fraser still calling and trying to keep his wind vane under control. I got the thumbs up that he didn‚Äôt need to get on HF, so I packed up. We had a brief celebration‚Äîthis was my first 10-pointer‚Äîand then turned around and headed back down.\n\n\n\nSuccess! ‚õ∞Ô∏èüìª\n\n\nOnce we were down out of the cloud, the view improved significantly! The cloud had started to lift, and we could see the surrounding summits and valleys‚Äîspectacular! Similar to the way up, paths came and went, but we had a clear view of the Dee and knew where to go.\n\n\n\nBack into the light\n\n\n\n\n\nPath back to Carn Cloich-mhuilinn\n\n\n\n\n\nMore 10 pointers\n\n\n\n\n\nDee in the background\n\n\nBack on the bikes and back towards civilisation. We had a quick stop at the Chest of Dee waterfalls, where the pool looked lovely and inviting, before the final 5km or so to the car park. Up, activated, and back in under 6 hours.\nFraser did well on 2m, with an FM contact into the Yorkshire coast, 310 km away. Although, I think he would‚Äôve liked some more SSB activity.\n\n\n\nMM0EFI/P on 2m\n\n\nBack home, and back to reality of family life. A great trip out, and thanks to Fraser for making it happen. I‚Äôve bought a lot of things since starting amateur radio, but didn‚Äôt think mountain bike shopping would next on my list! üöµ\nOSMaps route link.\nAlso posted to the SOTA Reflector."

There‚Äôs a dedicated car park, Tap O‚ÄôNoth car park, and a nice track all the way to the top, so it was a straight forward walk.

When you arrive you‚Äôre greeted with this huge lump that sticks out of the ground and looks imposing, I thought I took a photo but it appears not.\n\n\n\nLooking west to The Buck\n\n\nWith a few stops on the way, we all made it to the top in good time. The cloud had come in a little and it was much windier but still decent weather. The top of this hill used to be a fort back in the Dark Ages, and so offers plenty of shelter from the wind.\n\n\n\nFort remains\n\n\nI setup near the trig point in a nice recess in the side. I‚Äôd brought the G90 and my 5.5m vertical random wire. The G90 can match this tiny length of wire on any band, even 40m! Although probably longer wires would be better. I‚Äôd also brought my end fed half wave, but the 5.5m vertical is so fast to setup. As I was worried the novelty of watching me on the radio would wear off soon, and the cold wind would get to everyone, I stuck with this vertical. I gave 40m a shot, and did manage to just hear Phil, G4OBK. We were both 31 with each other. I then heard my HT as locals were chatting and asking if I‚Äôd already been and gone or what had happened. I‚Äôd emailed earlier in the day saying I was going up but had put 11am and we‚Äôd left later so it was closer to 11:30am.\n\n\n\nBraving the wind\n\n\nI had the RH-770 on the HT and joined in the conversation, saying I was on the summit. Simon, GM4JXP, and Chris, 2M0RVZ, quickly called in and I was more than qualified. Simon was testing a new home made 5 el yagi and was absolutely deafening when he called! I tried one more CQ but I‚Äôd done the job so thought it was time I packed up and headed down - we didn‚Äôt want to be late for lunch! My mum liked the chats we all had on 2m, and said everyone sounded very friendly. If I had been on 20m or higher frequencies, it might‚Äôve been exciting countries but nothing more than callsigns and RST exchanges.\n\n\n\nAdmiring the view\n\n\nThe trip down was easy enough, we actually met a few other walkers on their way up, and we were back in the car heading to Alford to try out a cafe for lunch. Soup and sandwiches all round with a sense of accomplishment by all. A very enjoyable trip out. Tap O‚ÄôNoth will be a good one to do during the Winter bonus period (30 Nov-14 Mar) to get 5 points from it! The shelter the old fort offers is very nice for keeping out of the cold winds!\n\n\n\nSuccess! üåÑ"

Even packed their own bags with toys and random things, including ice cream and tea sets for a picnic on the summit. We parked in Donview forest car park and followed the red route up. Quite a steep bit near the start with wooden steps that the kids started counting, but then eased off and a more gentle climb after that. Nice and sheltered in the trees for much of the way. When we did get near the summit the wind was blowing an absolute gale - which everyone found amusing. We hunkered down behind a rock and the kids has their snack and picnic and I tried 2m FM. Managed three and then was worried I wouldn‚Äôt get my fourth. Heard MM0EFI calling but he couldn‚Äôt hear me, so I walked over the summit to the west side, just holding the pole with the slim G waving as the wind was blowing and then managed the QSO and even one more after that. Glad I didn‚Äôt have to get out HF as I think the kids had had enough of me messing about. Plus we had to be back in time for swim training.\n\n\n\nAt the summit\n\n\nThe walk down was much easier, the little one started getting tired half way down but kept soldering on. We went into Kemney in search of a cafe for lunch but they were all closed except one. That one was mobbed and looked too fancy for us, so we had a picnic in the car from the Co-op!\n\n\n\nWell prepared\n\n\nLittle one is keen to go again and packed several backpacks in the garage, so will have to see what‚Äôs next for us.\n\n\n\nView towards Mither Tap"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Beasts of the land\n\n\nIn the land of Aberdeenshire, in the rolling hills and verdant fields, there lies a summit of ancient repute: the Hill of Garvock. High above the plains it stands, crowned with a tower of stone that pierces the sky like the dark spire of Barad-d√ªr itself. And though it is not the Eye of Sauron that watches from its heights, it is nonetheless guarded‚Äîby a herd of formidable beasts, more docile in appearance but no less territorial than the fell orcs of Mordor. These were not the servants of some dark lord, but of a farmer, who tended his cows with the same care one might afford to a legion of fearsome trolls.\n\n\n\nA warning left by a previous traveler\n\n\nYet, it was to this very summit that our company was bound, for in the air lay a quest most urgent: the activation of the Hill of Garvock, a task that would call forth the wizard‚Äôs skill in communicating across the very ether, from the highest point in the land.\nI, the wizard of our company, bore the mantle of Gandalf, though my power lay not in staff nor sword but in the ancient art of invisible communication. Deep within my pack lay a Kenwood D72, my 6m staff of carbon fiber, and the slim G that would beacon out into the surrounds. The winds would carry my signals to those far off in Aberdeen, and to those kindred spirits who also sought the heights to send their voices across the void. At my side marched four brave souls, each chosen for this journey by the fates, and not being legally allowed to be left at home alone.\nThere was Legolas, my eldest daughter, whose eyes were sharp and whose feet were swift. She would scout ahead, her keen senses attuned to the slightest disturbance in the fields. Princess Galadriel, my youngest daughter, whose beauty was only matched by her inability to carry anything, walked beside me, her grace a light in the darkening day. And then there were the two hobbits twins, whose hearts were as large as their stature was small, and whose constant complaining, kept the chill of the sea wind at bay.\nWe set forth from the edge of the Laurencekirk Viewpoint, the last outpost of civilisation before the untamed fields. The sky was overcast, and the air held the promise of rain, yet we were undeterred. Alas, we were also ill-prepared, with only half party bringing their cloaks. The path ahead led us across open land, where no tree or boulder might shield us from the vigilant eyes of the bovine sentinels.\n\n\n\nSuitable journeying attire\n\n\nThe cows, vast in number and broad of horn, gazed upon us with suspicion as we approached their domain. Legolas, ever watchful, whispered of their movements. ‚ÄúThey are gathering, Father,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúforming a line as if to bar our passage.‚Äù I nodded, drawing my cloak about me as though it might ward off the cows‚Äô ponderous gaze.\n‚ÄúFear not, my children,‚Äù I said, raising my carbon-6 mast. ‚ÄúWe have journeyed through lands more perilous than these (Edinburgh Airport customs border). Though the path is fraught with unseen dangers, we must press on.‚Äù\nAnd so we did, our footsteps light but purposefully avoiding cow pats, as we crossed the meadow. The hobbits skipped merrily, laughing as they narrowly avoided an enormous pat, recently produced. Princess Galadriel‚Äôs voice, soft as a whispering brook, soothed the beasts as we passed, her words lost to the wind but not to the cows, who turned away as though under some enchantment.\n\n\n\nThe tower and its guard\n\n\nAt last, we reached the final field before the tower, the summit of Garvock now within our grasp. The stone structure loomed above us, a sentinel of old, marking the land for miles around. As we stepped into the activation zone, the winds howled, and the clouds parted, allowing the briefest shaft of sunlight to illuminate our path.\nI raised my staff and sent out the call. The air shimmered with VHF magic, and our presence was made known across the land. The summit was activated, our voices carried far and wide, across hill and valley, to others who awaited our signal.\n\n\n\nThose who heard our calls - including a brave soul a‚Äôtop Ben Chonzie\n\n\nWe awoke a wizard of exceptional experience, housed in our home town of Aberdeen, who‚Äôs voice had not been heard on 2m FM for over 20 years, but whose relentless questioning and detailed itemisation of his wizarding horde kept us within the range of the cows for longer than anyone was content with.\nThe quest was complete, and though the way back was still guarded by those bovine watchers, we knew the day was ours. With spirits high and laughter on our lips, we descended from the Hill of Garvock, in search of a cafe in Johnshaven and with the memory of our adventure etched forever in our hearts."

He‚Äôs not been on the air in ages and was asking lots of questions. I sent him an email when I got home, and hopefully we will hear him on the air soon. It would be good to add him to the local SOTA chat for activator and chaser‚Ä¶but will see what happens.\nOff to the next summit!"

Again, a look at the snow gate cameras showed us it had all gone! The Glenshee camera shows you the side of Ben Gulabin. Gerald was heading up Corwharn, GM/ES-048, and I on Ben Gulabin. Somewhere between Mount Blair and Gulabin the quickest route from west Aberdeen flips from via the A90 to the A93, and so I drove the scenic route. The route up Gulabin is another straight forward one. Park off the road by the start and follow the path up.\n\n\n\nThere‚Äôs a bit of a stream to cross, and then quite a boggy area once you turn left off the track up to the summit. Probably made worse by the just recent snow melt.\n\nWhat started as another lovely morning, had started to turn a little. The wind was cold and the clouds were creeping in. It was still nice enough on Ben Gulabin but this would be the best of the day.\n\nI came to setup on 2m, and found I‚Äôd left my guys at home. This was even more annoying as they were in my bag from yesterday, and I‚Äôd gone through everything this morning before leaving and obviously left them on the garage floor. So I held the mast and carried on. It didn‚Äôt take too long to get four, and then speak with Gerald on his summit. His phone hadn‚Äôt been charging properly and so was dead, which meant he couldn‚Äôt spot. However, he shared his info and I could spot for him on 2m SSB, which worked out well. After that I packed up and headed back to the car and drive round to the start of Mount Blair."

    "text": "I‚Äôve been eyeing Lochnagar GM/ES-008 for a while, and this Thursday‚Äôs forecast was looking reasonable, so decided to take the day off. It‚Äôs little neighbour, Conachcraig GM/ES-019, is asking to be activated at the same time. I was going to take the common route starting at Glenmuick, but Fraser, MM0EFI, suggested biking from Balmoral castle.\nAs I was trying to fit this into the family schedule, any time I could save would be an advantage. I used plotaroute to figure out the times for the biking and hiking sections, matching the speed I think I move at, plus the drive back and forth, it looked like the cycle route would be the quickest. 8:05 hrs for the cycle route vs.¬†8:40 for the walk from Glenmuick (times include driving). I considered cycling from Glenmuick but supposedly the path isn‚Äôt great beyond the forest, so not really worth it.\nWas only a few degrees at the start in Crathie car park, but cycling generally uphill and in the sun I was soon roasting! It was around 1:15 cycle up to the intersection of Lochnagar and Conachcraig and I‚Äôd had enough of the bike! Much of the route is a gentle incline but there are areas where it‚Äôs steeper and much less enjoyable.\n\n\n\nSummit in sight\n\n\nI met a nice German couple on the way up Lochnagar. They‚Äôd been in Scotland for nearly 3 weeks and had brillant weather all round. Climbed Ben Nevis, Ben Lomond and visited several cities and towns.\n\n‚ÄúOf course the weather is always like this‚Äù.\n\nA german ham I know told me: ‚ÄúNice German‚Äù is as redundant as ‚Äúfalse error‚Äù or ‚Äúundead zombie‚Äù. His choice of words. Enough chit-chat, I had a schedule to keep and kept going.\n\n\n\nBoulders!\n\n\nI‚Äôve not been on a popular summit for a while and was surprised to see so many people on a random Thursday. I say so many people, it probably it was about 15, but compared to zero to two, it seemed a lot.\nThe forecast had said cloudy in the afternoon and I was due on the summit at 1300 local so I was hoping it would stay clear. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.\n\n\n\nLochnagar\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to the summit\n\n\nI waited my turn in the queue to take photos at the summit, offering to take those of others. The wind was strong at this point and you wanted to be sure of your footing whilst scrambling about on the top. The views were incredible in all directions, and anyone on a summit in GM/ES would‚Äôve had a great day.\n\n\n\nAt the top!\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking NW into the hills\n\n\nI‚Äôd made it to the top ahead of schedule but I spent a long time admiring the views and walking around. The wind was strong so I looked for somewhere sheltered and away from the main path to setup, but ended up just sitting on the grass to one side. With my back to the wind it wasn‚Äôt too bad. I setup the slim G on the 6m mast and used my HT to call CQ. I was hoping to qualify the summit on 2m and in short order to keep on my way. I also noticed the clouds rolling in from the south. Got 5 in the log, mostly the locals plus Jace MM7VXJ who called when I was eating a biscuit. Credit to Jace for trying to relay messages to Jack, GM4COX, who was a 59 for me but think I was a 01 for him, and he wanted to move to sideband. I was surprised not to get anyone else further south.\n\n\n\nSummit instructions from 1924\n\n\nTime to head back. I should‚Äôve taken a photo of Conachcraig from the summit, as it looked tiny from atop Lochnagar! All around the cliff edges are openings that just drop away, and on a lovely sunny day they‚Äôre interesting to look at but if it were cloudy these are a literal death trap!\n\n\n\nA straight down\n\n\nBack down, passed my bike, and then up to the next summit.\n\n\n\nConachcraig"

    "text": "Not wanting to waste a glorious day, I had time for a quick activation in the morning and The Buck was the recommendation.\n\n\n\nShort ascent\n\n\nThe route is pretty easy, not quite a straight line as I‚Äôve drawn but I parked slightly east on the road and walked up until I met this fence line. A quick march and you can be at the top in 30 minutes. The sub-500m area is pretty boggy and wet, even today when it hasn‚Äôt rained in a while. It was a little slow in places, trying to avoid plunging my feet into ankle deep water. The path is also vague at this stage but then becomes more defined within about 1km of the summit.\n\n\n\nView to the top\n\n\n\n\n\nSquelchy\n\n\nThe weather was amazing, brilliant sunshine, blue skies and not a breath of wind. I was roasting on the way up!\n\n\n\nTrig point on top of the rocky summit\n\n\nEven at the top the wind was minimal, and I‚Äôve never seen my carbon-6 stand so straight at a summit before! I made use of the nice clear hole in the trig point and put the mast in it with the slim g on top. I could see for miles and miles!\n\n\n\nSetup for 2m\n\n\nI was hoping it would be a quick activation on 2m, as I needed to get back home by lunchtime, and this summit would cover a huge area. Back from his hols in Barbados, MM0EFI was first in the log. After 5 minutes, Bill in Aberdeen, GM0NRT, called back, and whilst we were talking I heard another station call. This time it was GM0UDL up in Fortrose, just north of Inverness who had seen my Lora tracker being picked up by GM4SJB (even further north!). He told me about his lora setup and how everyone around that area has setup iGates and DMR repeaters. Sounds like a great setup they have. Not long afterwards my fourth 2m contact, needed to qualify the summit, came from GM8ZKU across to the east by the coast. Again, another nice QSO with Simon for the first time. Time was getting on and I did need to be back home, I tried on more CQ but then called it a day.\nI\n\n\n\nLooking North\n\n\nhad a quick look around for the ancient engravings but couldn‚Äôt find them. It was a quick walk back down the hill to the car. I‚Äôd forgotten about the sogginess but managed to escape with dry feet.\nWhen I got home I looked up the Lora tracking on EA2RCF‚Äôs mapping page, and was surprised to see just how far away GM4SJB‚Äôs receiving igate was! It had also tracked me nearly the whole route up and down, which I then realised was me walking the county boundaries. The power on the tracker is tiny and the antenna isn‚Äôt amazing but this time it all worked well. I‚Äôve been carrying it with me on most summits but there haven‚Äôt been any igates nearby that have picked me up.\n\n\n\nLora 70cm distance\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking my route\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeedy!\n\n\nA nice quick 4-pointer summit - I‚Äôm beginning to think Morven is a brutal 4-pointer! - although not for a wet day, or post a lot of rain. The summit is quite exposed, although maybe you could find some shelter depending on the wind direction. It‚Äôs a popular summit to do with Tap O‚ÄôNoth, as that‚Äôs just a few miles away, however, I just didn‚Äôt have time on this occasion. Maybe they‚Äôll be a good combo next year during the winter bonus period.\n\n\n\nWhat the Buck"

For a while I still thought I could do both until I realised my time spreadsheet had an error, although it took writing an email to someone saying I was going to be on Ben Tirran at 2pm‚Ä¶and then home by 3pm :thinking: Anyway, I decided to just do Ben Tirran as it‚Äôs taller‚Ä¶(only if it were 4m taller still‚Ä¶)\n\n\n\nCar park and cafe\n\n\nStarting by Wheen farm, there‚Äôs a little area off the road where you can park, and, at some point during the year, even buy some refreshments!\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs on the menu\n\n\nThe cloud was low but wind was minimal, and it was mild at 10 degC. The path is straight forward from the car park, with a small stream crossing at one point.\n\n\n\nLooking west down Glen Clova\n\n\n\n\n\nPath ahead\n\n\nI did miss the turning, and then stomped across the heather to find the path. When I came back down I looked to see why I‚Äôd missed the turning‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nTurn off here‚Ä¶\n\n\nPerhaps on a clear day it would be more obvious, and the small cairn would stand out.\nAs I reached the summit, it was getting brighter, and I had hopes of the sun breaking through. I setup on 2m with the FT65 and RH770 and called a few times. Soon enough I had five contacts, including G6BIA down by Newcastle - who I also got on Mount Battock the other week.\n\n\n\nFog bow\n\n\nA surprise one was Fraser, MM0EFI, at home, with Mount Keen right between us. At this point the clouds parted and I was in glorious sunshine.\n\n\n\nLooking south\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth to Mount Keen\n\n\n\n\n\nTrig Point\n\n\nAlso out was Denis, MM0CBC, up on holiday from Wales. He was on GM/ES-027 and we had a nice summit to summit on 2m. Also impressive given the high peaks of Lochnagar, and Beinn a‚ÄôBhuird were between us.\nSeveral people reported my audio kept dropping and I was difficult to hear, but the carrier was still strong. Think I‚Äôve come to the conclusion the FT-65 mic/design isn‚Äôt that great (judging from commentary online) and even though I‚Äôm right next to it when talking, small movements cause the levels to drop. That sounded annoying for those at the other end, especially after I‚Äôd witter on for 3 minutes and they only heard every 5th word.\n\n\n\nSetup for HF\n\n\nI setup for 40m and had plenty of contacts. I‚Äôd arrived at the summit sooner than I expected, and so could afford to spend more time on the radio. I tried chasing a few other summits, although not too many active at the time, but made contact with HB9CYX and @DG4SFF. Tried a little 10m, and was rewarded with W4GO and N2BTD on the east of the US. I thought about changing from my sloper L antenna to a vertical but then realised I didn‚Äôt have enough time for that. Packing up I heard someone calling on 2m and ended up having a chat with a few others. At this point I was now behind schedule and had to get a move on! Back into the cloud and a quick trot down to the car.\n\n\n\nBack at the farm\n\n\nA very enjoyable day out. It‚Äôs a nice summit, with good take off for 2m, some shelter at the trig, and lovely views when the cloud clears. I could see many summits peaking above the clouds - Mount Keen, Lochnagar, and even across to Ben Avon. On a cloudless day, I bet the views would be stunning all round.\nIt‚Äôs almost been two years since anyone came here, Fraser being the last of course 2. Perhaps the route from either north or south isn‚Äôt great, and there are plenty of other options closer from both sides. However, it would be one I‚Äôd recommend. I did get Tim, G5OLD, on 40m and so now he‚Äôs compelled to come up for a complete.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nAlso posted on the reflector."

    "text": "Fraser, MM0EFI, messaged asking who wanted to do a Munro midweek, and I thought it was a good opportunity to go. He also rallied Chris, 2M0RVZ, and Simon, GM4JXP. I decided to go up An Socach, whilst Fraser and Chris were going up Carn a‚ÄôGheoidh, and Simon on Glas Maol. A notice was posted on the reflector, and several others were keen to go up summits in Scotland and England. Later on we came to realise that the time posted on the reflector and Alerts was two hours late! Oops‚Ä¶no wonder no-one else turned up ‚Äúat the right time‚Äù.\n\n\n\nCar Park\n\n\nI got to the start around 7:45, and it was a chilly start, with -1.5 degC in Braemar as I drove through, however, the weather was stunning with clear blue skies and not a breath of wind.\nI cycled along the estate track until the actual ascent starts - probably saves about 20-30 minutes walking each way, as I thought Fraser and Chris would have a quicker walk back on their summit. I need to buy an actual mountain bike as this and Mount Keen the other week have felt like I was going to shake the bike, and me, to pieces. The bike made a helpful support when crossing the ford before turning up the hill.\n\n\n\nBike ends here\n\n\nQuite boggy on the way up until the final steep ascent onto the long plateau.\n\n\n\nUp to the plateau\n\n\nThe first cairn is only 6m below the actual summit but still around 2km away. At this point I called in with Fraser and Chris on the HT, and they were a similar 1.5km away from their summit.\n\n\n\nPassing the residents\n\n\nLots of good views and, as already said, lovely weather! I found a nice grassy patch near to the cairn to setup the yagi.\n\n\n\nYagi and IC-705\n\n\nSome good QSOs on 2m FM and SSB, not quite what Fraser managed but his summit was higher and so he was in the way! üòÖ\n\n\n\nPink for FM and green for SSB\n\n\nAfter calling for a long time on sideband I was impatient on FM and kept jumping around when I saw activity on the waterfall, either following Fraser like an annoying puppy, or jumping onto the calling frequency when it was free. Probably should‚Äôve just stayed still!\nI made use of the flat plateau and large activation zone to start heading back but still ready with the HT for Alan, MM0VPM. SotaGoat app kept me in check and that saved a bit of time coming back. My worries of being slow down were unnecessary as I ended up being at the Bothy for a full round of cakes before the others arrived‚Ä¶and I couldn‚Äôt let them feel guilty for eating in front of me.\nG4IPB reported hearing me on from Blencathra - in the lake district just north of Keswick - and after seeing his report I realised that I also heard him but we were in the middle of some other QSOs so I never followed up and changed frequency. I was only on the HT and RH770 but he‚Äôd give me 55 and he was clear to me, although the first QSO was a bit muffled and dogs barking made it unclear.\nThe views were spectacular all around, with snow on the high summits."

It certainly looked small from Lochnagar summit but it‚Äôs still a respectable 865m tall.\n\n\n\nLooking down on Conachcraig from Lochnagar\n\n\nIt felt like a short, straight up route on a nice track. I turned and looked back at Lochnagar and could see the cloud hovering over the summit, although not submerging it.\n\n\n\nClouds looming on Lochnagar\n\n\nThe rock formations on Conachcraig are interesting to look at, I haven‚Äôt really got a good photo of them so you‚Äôll have to go there yourself. Unsurprisingly, no-one else was at this summit with me and I ducked down behind a rock to keep out the wind whilst I setup again on 2m.\n\n\n\nStation location\n\n\nThanks again to Fraser, MM0EFI, and Chris, 2M0RVZ for their contacts on both summits, then with Simon, GM4JXP, and finally Richie, GM1LKD, in Aberdeen I was set. It was now 3:05pm, and I needed to be home by 5pm, and with an hour+ drive, it was time to pack up and head back to my bike.\n\n\n\nBack on the bike, and bye bye Lochnagar!\n\n\nThe downhill bike ride back only took 20 minutes, and was a great way to end the trip. 28 km all in, and home in time!"

    "text": "It‚Äôs been a few weeks since my last activation and I wanted to go out. I didn‚Äôt have much time as I was meant to be sorting out the garage, so I picked a summit close to home, Cairn-Mon-Earn (GM/ES-080).\n\n\n\nSSE working on one of the towers\n\n\nIt‚Äôs quite an easy walk following the loggers roads up to the summit. There are multiple towers there for mobile phones and other networks. The local repeater, GB3GN, is also here. The weather was dry, and I had the occasional blue sky, but showers were forecasted.\nIt was windy too, so I hunkered down by the cairn, however, this probably wasn‚Äôt the best place being so close to the towers. I setup my slim G 2m on the mast and called CQ. I didn‚Äôt get any response so setup on HF. The ground slopes away with heather and bushes, so I decided just to go for the random wire vertical. It has a 5.5m radiator and 2 counterpoises. I started on 20m, and two stations replied, Spain and Finland. This turned out to be my lot on HF. I tried other bands and calling other stations but no one could hear me. It was a shame as there were several other summits I could hear.\n\n\n\nSlim G on the carbon 6 mast\n\n\nI managed to get MM0EFI on the HT, and so I was at 3 contacts. A SOTA summit needs 4 to activate. It had been about an hour and the rain started to come down heavily. I dashed across to some nearby trees and setup underneath one of them. After trying all the bands I came back to 20m, put out another spot and the same Spanish station came back to me‚Ä¶well at least I knew it wasn‚Äôt operator error with the radio or antenna!\n\n\n\nUnder the tree\n\n\n\n\n\nWet!\n\n\nThis was meant to be a quick activation and I‚Äôd now been there for over and hour, and so decided to pack up HF. I could see the TV mast in the clouds and so walked over to get a better look. I then found what would be a great spot to activate (if it wasn‚Äôt raining) as it had clear views all around. I thought I might as well call on 2m and see if I could get anyone.\nI spoke to Fraser again, MM0EFI, now /M as he was driving to work. We made a contact with his intermediate callsign, 2M0EFI/M, so technically I‚Äôd activated the site. However, I was determined to get four different people, and in my next CQ, George, MM0SAX/M, replied.\n\n\n\nView across the to TV mast\n\n\nGeorge was driving up from Glasgow on the A90 and has a radio in his work van. We had a nice chat for about 15 minutes, and that turned my ‚Äúthis has been a waste of time ü§¨‚Äù attitude into a ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt so bad üôÇ‚Äù one!\nI enjoy HF and setting up different antenna, but if I could reliably activate with just 2m/70cm I‚Äôd love to go up the hillside with just my HT.\n\n\n\nBefore I knew what the activation would entail\n\n\nIt was back down and back home. The kids were soon home from school and the garage didn‚Äôt get sorted out. I‚Äôll try again next week‚Ä¶"

    "text": "Fraser shared last night that the snow gates were shut due to the snow. When the sun came up this morning, it was a glorious sunny, crisp, cold day with amazing views of the hills. At 8:30am when I was about to leave the gates were still shut‚Ä¶I was going with a work friend up the hill and he felt confident the gates would be opened by 10. After passing endless signs telling me the road was closed, and finally at 10:15 am when I arrived at Cock Bridge‚Ä¶they were still shut. My friend was about 15 minutes behind me, and so I waited for him by Corgarff Castle.\n\nI‚Äôd looked at an alternative route to the summit from here, in case the gates were closed. It is possible but it‚Äôs twice as far, at around 18.5 km each way.\n\nThis was too far for my friend and if I was going to do it, he‚Äôd maybe only come part way. I was also trying to calculate how long we‚Äôd be and if I‚Äôd get back home in time for birthday tea with the family! As we were chatting we heard a loud rumbling of a gritter coming along the road. We watched him go up past the trees to where the gate is‚Ä¶road noise stops‚Ä¶engine quietens‚Ä¶CLANG! of metal against metal‚Ä¶ that would be the gates being opened! So we headed back and got to the snow gates and sure enough he‚Äôd opened them and was heading up. He gave us the thumbs up and we followed.\n\nOnce he opened the gates at the ski centre we were off to Tomintoul. We parked in the village opposite the hotel, rather than the parking on the route, mostly to be certain we could drive in and out again, and got ready to roll. At 9.9 km each way, this was a much more reasonable distance, and on a good day (i.e.¬†not today) would probably only take about an hour to 1:15hrs to ride.\n\nThe track down to the bridge (around 5 km) was absolutely treacherous with ice and in some places was just sheet ice across the whole track. I only fell off once and somehow managed to do a magic trick of falling onto my feet in a standing position as the bike slid out from under me and away down the road. We dropped our seats, put out our feet as stablisers and skated down some parts of it. The track is also quite undulating and several ups and downs to make you groan.\nI just happened to check my phone and saw Fraser had spotted. We were down in the valley by the river and I didn‚Äôt expect much luck (although I was getting phone signal of course), and put out a call to him. He was in a QSO with GM0HLV but then we made contact. Chris was setting up but we kept going and when I checked later I‚Äôd missed him.\n\n\nThe bridge across the river wasn‚Äôt much better, probably made worse by the fact cold air can get under as well as above it, but we made it over okay. We met some coos at the remote Wester Gaulrig Cottage, and at this point had probably been going for about 50 minutes.\n\nWe were past half way but still plenty to go, and now the steeper parts of the route were upon us. We could see the summit in the distance, and partially doubted that it was correct as ‚Äúit seemed so far away‚Äù. We were correct, it was the summit!\n\nI dumped my bike at the base of the final ascent, but my friend Mike, on his ebike, gave it a shot to get to the top. The snow had drifted much more here and snow pattern told tales of strong winds. The cloud was coming in now and the good views across to Ben Avon and surroundings had gone, with only huge clouds looming over the distant high summits.\n\nWe made it at 12:30, 1.5 hours after leaving Tomintoul, and much later than my alert. Fraser and Chris were just back at their landys for my first two QSOs on Cnap Chaochan Aitinn. I called a few more times on 2m but didn‚Äôt have any luck. I wasn‚Äôt that patient with it though and chose not to setup the slim g but just go straight to 40m ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd come all this way, I couldn‚Äôt leave without the 40 on 40 on 40! The wind was brutal and oh so cold. We did have some equipment that we could hide behind, and took some shelter there whilst I tried to setup on 40m.\n\nI‚Äôm sure I could‚Äôve used the small towers there to my benefit, but I was also wary of the wind turbine and getting wire caught in it, so I setup my mast down wind of it, trying to keep it close enough so I could operate from the shelter. Typically, as soon as I spotted and called CQ once the mast moved, then fell. It was tricky finding ground to get the pegs in for the guys‚Ä¶so I recruited another guy to hold the mast whilst he ate his super noodles!\n\n\nI managed 6 on 40m, including a very nice summit to summit with Colin, M1BUU, as above, before I had to call QRT on the pile up. It was just too cold in the wind, even in the ‚Äúshelter‚Äù. Quickly packed up and whilst admiring the views I realised the wind turbine noise had stopped and there was, in fact, no wind whatsoever! I got the HT back out and messaged Dave, MM7HMA, a local who‚Äôs just past his test and was keen to get some QSOs, and we had a nice chat. The stillness didn‚Äôt last and the return of the wind reminded us it was time to head back.\n\n\n\nBack to the bike - still there üòÖ- and back to the car. It‚Äôs mostly downhill, but still a few steep climbs as the path goes up and down. The temperature had come up a little, and a fair amount of ice had melted so the journey was less hazardous. I was back home in plenty of time.\n\nNot quite the S2S action hoped for, but still a successful trip and good day out! üéÇPlus one more complete for Fraser üòÖ\nI think no-one comes here as there are other summits in the area you‚Äôd do first, but the fact you can cycle right to the top does make it quite a unique one, plus with plenty of refreshment options in Tomintoul for afterwards!"

    "text": "A lovely sunny day, and time for another activation. Hopefully better than the last ‚Äì certainly the weather was better. üåû\nQuite a close summit to home, Brimmond Hill overlooks Aberdeen and the airport to the east and then Aberdeenshire to the west. There‚Äôs a walk up and over it which is popular with dog walkers, and so I met more people than I usually do on this summit. The hill also features several commercial towers which make a bit of noise on 2m. Usually a pip every so often and then a huge blast of rf that completely wipes anything out, interestingly around the 2m and 70cm calling frequencies but not so bad away from them.\n\n\n\nLooking towards the sea\n\n\n\n\n\nMast up and ready\n\n\n\n\n\nNoise machine\n\n\nI tried 2m first, with the Slim G on the pole and made a couple of contacts locally. There‚Äôs a bench that looks out over Aberdeen that I was going to setup on, but the aforementioned dog walkers came by and sat on the bench, so I decided to move off and find a spot in the heather. MM7RVC recorded me calling at his house somewhere to the west, showing off his pole and slim G ‚Äì so we got a SG2SG QSO.\nVideo\nFor HF I went with the EFHW for 40m, with the 49:1 (keep meaning to write up making that but not got round to it yet! Nothing special mind), setup on the 6m carbon pole. Generally running north-south. The weather was lovely, there was a breeze but it wasn‚Äôt too cold, and so for most of the time I tried chasing other summit activators. This worked well, as I ended up with five summit-to-summit (S2S) QSOs across England, German, Austria and Poland. I then put out spots for myself and got a few more contacts.\nI think the battery was low in the radio as it was only outputting 5W, not that 10W would‚Äôve made a huge difference, but I still find it impressive what 5W can do.\n\n\n\nQSO Map\n\n\nIt was time to pack up, and I thought I‚Äôd see if I could catch anyone else on VHF/UHF. There‚Äôs a local lunchtime net, although I can never remember if its 12:30, 1 or 1:30pm that it starts. I got my Slim G back out and on the mast and this time I did sit on the bench. The net was going on and after a long over I managed to break in and say hello. We also did a quick QSO on 70cm. I‚Äôm not sure if the Slim G is suitable for 70cm. It worked but at what SWR? I should measure it and see. Another couple with their dog came up and wanted to come to the view point but one look of me and they decided to keep going! üòÖ At this point my HT ran out of battery too!\n\n\n\nSlim G in the wind\n\n\n\n\n\nAction shot!\n\n\nIf I was YouTubing myself, everyone would think it normal! I ended up overtaking the couple walking back to the car. I said ‚ÄúHi‚Äù but no QSL on that contact."

    "text": "Next summit of the day. A short drive up the A96 and off at Colpy to Hill of Foudland. I was approaching from the east so I was close to Tillymorgan but it‚Äôs not a very exciting route. I think there‚Äôs a better one from the east. I‚Äôd read on Walkinghighlands that there‚Äôs more parking in the forest, beyond the limits of the public road. Not sure if this is really allowed or not but it seemed better than parking on essentially nothing, as I was out of the way. This also saved me some walking along a boring track. After the chat with G0JSO, I was 30 minutes later than planned, and so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to make it in time to get at the summit for the lunchtime 2m net.\n\n\n\nView south to Bennachie\n\n\nAs I was walking up I had my HT tuned into 145.550 MHz listening out for them. I managed to call into the net and said I was hiking up and I‚Äôd come back to them when I was at the top. I knew the top was quite flat, and watching SOTAGoat app I saw I was within the activation zone but still a good ~650 m from the actual summit point. At this stage I setup the telescopic pole between my legs with the slim G on the top.\n\n\n\n3D printed part to keep it attached to mast\n\n\nOn the way up, with the RH770, Bill and Paul couldn‚Äôt hear me (nor I Paul), but once I had the slim G up on the 6m mast, everyone was a very good signal. So I had three from the net and Mike was trying break in but the other guys kept chatting! Eventually it came round to me and I was answering their questions and building up to bringing Mike in when the D72 died on me! Luckily I had the 705 and got that hooked up. I rejoined and explained, plus got Mike in. If I just had the KX2 I‚Äôd been annoyed about that one!\n\n\n\nTowers\n\n\nI was sat right in front of the towers but they were quiet on 145.550. I think the 705 had some issues with them but I turned off the pre-amp and that seemed to keep it calm. I said my goodbyes and turned back down the path to my third and final summit of the day!\n\n\n\nTillymorgan, left of the wind turbines"

    "text": "After Hill of Fare, I drove across to Benaquhallie, and parked by the side of an old farm building. There‚Äôs not really much space to park, and I think the house is still occupied so you can‚Äôt block the road, but maybe two cars could park there.\n\n\n\nPark at the red dot and follow the path\n\n\nThe route up is fairly easy going, you walk east in front and around the summit before turning back on yourself and climbing up to the top. There‚Äôs a trig point where the summit marker is but then down the hill a little, along that path, is the cairn.\n\n\n\nImagine Peace\n\n\nI started with 2m at the trig point and managed 3, and then another 3 on 70cm. Meanwhile Chris, MM7RVP, was up Cairn-mon-earn and calling CQ on 2m as well. The four of us could hear him but he seemed to struggle to recieve. Like I did, there‚Äôs quite a bit of QRM from the communications towers there and I think his handheld was getting overloaded.\n\n\n\nSlim G by the cairn\n\n\nI setup the Slim G to see if that would help get through the Chris, but no luck again. So I took it down and setup HF. I did manage to get Chris on both 40m and 20m, for our summit to summit. I then called on 20m and ended up with another 11 EU contacts, including a summit to summit in Switzerland.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nI was pleased to manage two summits in one day. I had to be back for school pickup so timing wise it worked out quite well. There was a 1:20 gap between my last contact on Hill of Fare and my first on Benaquhallie, so these pair are a good combo, espeically if you can activate on VHF/UHF!\nMike, 2M0WMA, also taught us all, over the air, how to pronounce Benaquhallie. It‚Äôs something like ‚Äúben-a-whallie‚Äù, but with some good accent on the Wh. I think I was the only whallie that day.\n\n\n\nSSummit selfie"

    "text": "Misty start\n\n\nI‚Äôve been eyeing Hunt Hill, GM/ES-042, for a while, but wanted a relatively calm day, as judging from previous reports and the internet, there isn‚Äôt much shelter on the summit. It‚Äôs also on my list of summits I can do when I have to do both school drop off and pick up. I decided to take the normal (not stupid? - again, relative! üßë‚Äçüî¨) route from Glen Esk.\n\n\n\nFrozen Loch Lee\n\n\nI had my bike and would cycle to the footbridge over the Lee, then head straight up and across to the summit. For my return, I wanted to see the waterfalls and so walk down to the Falls of Damff and then follow the water and path back to the bike - easy!\n\n\n\nUpside down\n\n\nIt was glorious sunshine and blue skies in Aberdeen and all the way there‚Ä¶until about 3 miles from the car park, when the cloud or fog came in. I was optimistic that the summit would still be in the sun and this was just some valley mist.\n\n\n\nBridge and climb ahead\n\n\nThe cycle is along a nice track and relatively flat the whole way. Whilst the scenery was stunning, you can still enjoy it on a bike and save a lot of time! I dumped the bike in the heather just before the footbridge. The ground before and after the bridge was sheet ice, so some careful maneuvering to get on and off the bridge was required!\n\n\n\nBack towards the loch\n\n\nFrom here it was straight up the hill as best as possible. There are occasional paths but these seem to run all over the place and not necessarily where I wanted to go.\n\n\n\nStraight up\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a balance of taking a longer route and going further away from the summit, but gentler gradient and trying to take a shortcut but end up facing more and more vertical sections. No surprises what route I tried.\n\nOnce on the top it‚Äôs an easier incline up to the summit, getting a little steeper as you near.\n\n\n\nUp to the summit\n\n\nAs I climbed higher the amount of snow increased, and in places it covered large sections of the hillside. It did mean the peat hags were filled in with snow and I could skip across them. Interestingly most of the snow was on the southern side of the hill.\n\n\n\nAs required under the obligations of climbing GM/ES, Fraser MM0EFI, was looking for a complete, and so we were hopeful on 2m. He was working but that doesn‚Äôt usually stop him from nipping out for a quick QSO. I‚Äôd alerted for 11:30am and needed to be on time, so that Fraser could serve the real workers of Westhill their christmas dinner. I was ready by 11:30 but Fraser was busy, so I admired the view whilst eating my chicken roll.\n\n\n\nLochnagar\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top with Lochnagar behind\n\n\n\n\n\n2m Station - Mount Keen Behind\n\n\nFraser let me know he was on his way, and I just put out a call and we managed to work whilst he was still in the car park! I did call further on 2m but all quiet. So I switch to HF. There was a slight breeze on the summit, and the air was cold, so I wasted some time wandering about seeing if there was a better spot that offered a bit of shelter. I decided there wasn‚Äôt and just got on with it. I setup for 40m, spotted and called CQ. It took a few goes calling CQ before anyone replied. Recently there are already several stations waiting after I do my first call. However, the chasers soon started and I had a nice steady stream, offering the chance for a quick chat beyond the usual RST and thanks. I think the surrounding beauty reflected in my voice as several commented on how cheerful I was. Or something like that.\n\n\n\nHF Setup\n\n\n10 minutes on the air and after the faffing about at the start, I was running short on time, and decided not to try chasing summits and pack up, and continue my route. This didn‚Äôt start well as I proceeded to march off in the completely wrong direction as I‚Äôd ‚Äúseen the stream‚Äù and knew where to go. I had seen a stream but it was the Burn of Damff to the west, rather than the falls to the south. I wasn‚Äôt too far off and reoriented back the right way.\n\n\nA classic cause of issues at work is ‚Äútime pressure‚Äù, people making bad choices because they are or think they are short on time. That was me and the thought of school pick up in a few hours time.\n\nI‚Äôm not stupid. I‚Äôll take a shortcut.\n\nI could see and hear the waterfalls below and without looking at any map decided I could join the path from here. Perhaps I should‚Äôve taken advice from others before me 4‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nStraight down\n\n\nIt was tricky to take photos of the route to demonstrate just how silly it was, partially as I was using my hands to hold trees, clumps of grass or rock faces as I scrambled down the side.\n\n\nThere was one moment where I came to a dead end, and the only way to go was edge past a huge boulder on about 20 cm of grass above a 5-6m drop. Of course it wasn‚Äôt the only way, I could go back the way I came but you know‚Ä¶tick tock tick tock ‚åöüëÄ. In this moment the wise words of my wife came into my head, and I, too, thought ‚Äúthis is stupid‚Äù. ü§¶\n\n\nI pressed on and made it üòÖ and soon reached the path by the water. The small streams running off the hill top made some impressive icicles on the rock faces, and the waterfalls were impressive and loud!\n\nBack to the bike through a very chilly gully. I met another hiker admiring the views at the footbridge and he shared some of his adventures over the years in the area.\n\n\nThe cycle back was speedy, it‚Äôs slightly downhill the whole way, and home with enough time for a cup of tea before the school bell rings!"

I‚Äôd looked at the forecast and it was meant to be partially sunny, but I was wondering if it had changed but I‚Äôd not seen it.

This significantly helped the trip as I‚Äôm not sure my hiking partner would‚Äôve been too pleased other wise! She immediately commented that the first path looked steep. She wasn‚Äôt wrong, it was the steepest part of the journey, although later on, on the way back, it was taxing again.\n\n\n\nThe route\n\n\nYou walk around the lifts and towards another summit before descending and then ascending again to the final summit. Alone, and determined, I reckon I could do it in 45 minutes, but today it took us 1:15, with a couple of stops to sit down for a bit.\n\n\n\nView of summit from Beinn A‚ÄôChruinnich by the ski lifts\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmiring the bogs we crossed\n\n\nThe peat bogs weren‚Äôt too bad and quite dry, but I can imagine after some rainfall they‚Äôd be very squelchy.\n\n\n\nAt the top!\n\n\nWe made it up the last slope, watching every meter on SOTAGoat app! I emptied out the snacks and set to work getting on 2m.\n\n\n\nSlim G on Carbon-6 mast\n\n\nAnnoyingly my Kenwood D72 wouldn‚Äôt turn on. It had died on Foudland during the week and I assumed it was just flat. I‚Äôd charged it and the charging light had turned green so I assumed all was good. Well no, it wasn‚Äôt. I tried fiddling with the battery clip to get it out but couldn‚Äôt work the mechanism and soon gave up on it. I had an old TH-79 with me which did turn on (although the LCD screen doesn‚Äôt show all the segments and is difficult to read). I have tested the TH-79 at home and it transmitted, but no-one could hear me and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was really working.\nI didn‚Äôt want to spend too long faffing about as the summit is very exposed, and whilst it was a nice day, my daughter would soon get cold just sitting around. So I switched to HF. I debated between the 5.5m random wire vertical or the 40m EFHW. I wanted to go on 40m and the random wire isn‚Äôt necessarily great for 40m. However, I should‚Äôve just gone with the vertical. As I was rushing, it meant it took me ages to get setup as things kept going wrong. Eventually I was sorted, but then the challenge of finding a free frequency. Seemed to be a contest going on, bunkers on the air and all sorts, but I did manage. Got 5 on 40m, including two locals from the SOTA Whatsapp group and that meant success! I thought I‚Äôd quickly try 20m. I heard one faint German station but when I looked up the cloud had come right in and we were sat in it. I knew it was time to go, and so we quickly packed up and started heading down. A summit in the cloud is disorientating and cold.\n\n\n\nFrom fun to fog in five seconds\n\n\nWe headed back down, and wanted to cut off part of the path up to the first summit, and follow the contours around. We were sort of successful but did get caught up in the bog and ended up walking a bit further downhill than we should‚Äôve. Again, the cloud level didn‚Äôt help. It was a big of a struggle to get back on to the path at the top of the ski runs but we made it, and then it was an easy downhill from there.\nQuite the change when we got to the bottom, the nice view at the start of this post was replaced by white cloud!\n\n\n\nWhat wind turbine?\n\n\nI‚Äôm glad we arrived when we did, else it would‚Äôve been quite miserable and the only excitement of the radio activation wouldn‚Äôt have been shared by all!\nWe stopped at the Spar in Bellabeg for some diet coke and a jam swiss roll, which we ate nearly half each before driving home.\nThere are a few more 4 pointers in the area, and hopefully I can get back to do some of those. Most have been activated less than 10 times, which suggests they‚Äôre maybe not that exciting or easy to get to. Brown Cow Hill, Geallaig, and Mona Gowan don‚Äôt seem too bad, so perhaps I should try those first.\nWhen I got home I checked the D72. It wouldn‚Äôt turn on, but when I plugged in an external power supply it turned on and then worked fine on battery. I don‚Äôt like the reliability of this, and being caught out on a summit again. I might get a new battery pack but I also might look for another HT. Perhaps a Yeasu FT-65 etc. that has great battery life is just a simple HT."

Well this turned into a very wet affair, and I gradually made my way across to the path, like I should‚Äôve from the start.\n\n\n\nSummit ahead in the blue skies\n\n\nAfter the drive over the Mount Blair and looking at the summit with clear blue skies backdrop, the cloud started to move in and blue became grey.\n\n\n\nSkies turning grey\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking back at Mealna Letter\n\n\nSome SSE folks were up doing things on the mast. They‚Äôd come up in their 8 wheeled buggy, some kind of Argocat. They were finishing up as I was looking at the trig and other features. They gave me a cheerful wave as they tootled past to go down the hill.\n\n\n\nSummit things\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSE mobile\n\n\nLots of fences and rocks and all sorts to setup on the top. I decided to the south of the main mast by the fence would be good. As I had no guys, I needed something decent to strap the mast to, and setup on 40m. I had a quick QSO with Gerald again, who was on his way down, and I wanted to make this quick as it had started raining and the cold wind wasn‚Äôt enjoyable. Not as busy on the band as Monday but enough.\n\n\n\nStation\n\n\nPacked up and headed back down to the car. I‚Äôd hoped Gerald and I could‚Äôve found a nice cafe or bar to say hello, but there aren‚Äôt many options in the area. In fact, none as far as I could tell. There is the Glenisla Hotel, although that seems to shut its bar/cafe out of season on non-Friday/weekend days. So I waited by the car for Gerald to come by. We had a little chat and nice to put a face to a voice! Then off back home.\nIt‚Äôs a nice area with lots of good hills in close proximity. It would make for a good group SOTA outing - perhaps doing two hills each and rotating around, then back to the hotel bar for a celebration afterwards.\nNow I‚Äôve got to try and get back down there to Crock, GM/ES-056, Hare Cairn, GM/ES-063, Corwharn, GM/ES-048, and maybe even Cat Law, GM/ES-044, before the winter bonus period ends!"

The small waterfalls would trap air underneath and then the bubbles would travel under the ice for a few meters before escaping.\n\n\n\nFrozen burns\n\n\nThe summit was hard to find, my GPS route had come to an end but I couldn‚Äôt see anything. Some general blind amberling around eventually found it hidden in the cloud. I was a bit disappointed in the cairn, I was hoping I could at least hide in it, and even when crouched down behind it, the wind still got me.\n\n\n\nAt the summit!\n\n\nI then proceeded to spend ages messing about, trying to get setup on HF, but nothing would stay still. The wind pulled out guys and pegs, it bent the top of mast over 90¬∞ and so wires would come off, I angled the mast 35¬∞ off the ground into the wind, and the top still bent over enough for the wire to be pulled off. I held the mast with my body weight but still the wind could pick me up with only the surface area of the mast! Just when I had everything set for 40m it all blew down :sweat_smile: I thought I‚Äôd try 2m but that was just as challenging. I could hear the local lunch time net in Aberdeen but it was hard to get a word in edgeways and I‚Äôm not sure they could hear me anyway. So back to HF it was, this time with a short 5.5m vertical random wire for 20m. This I did manage to make some contacts with but, again, the wind blew me and the mast over mid-way through a QSO. By this time I was fed up, cold and wet, but had qualified the summit, so it was time to go! Also, there was no signal just behind the cairn‚Ä¶to add to the fun.\n\n\n\nWhich way was it?\n\n\nI generally took the same route back, without a compass, or device with a compass, it would be impossible to know which way to go. At one point on the way back it was so windy I could lean into the wind and it would hold me up! But I was soon back at The Sneck and heading down, and it wasn‚Äôt long before the conditions were more pleasant again. The weather wasn‚Äôt quite so nice down in the valley on the way back, but much nicer than on the summits. Found my bike, generally took the same route back, and was pleased to arrive back at the car to drive home.\n\n\n\nBack down and out of the clouds\n\n\nA big day out for me, 38 km or so round trip‚Ä¶and did I mention it was windy? üçÉ\nAlso on the SOTA reflector."

Other tools can be seen on the wiki pages of the two loggers. I had this working on another laptop but for various reasons was using a different one. I‚Äôd setup the vertical again in the garden and brought out the FTDX10 to use. I spent ages faffing about trying to get this to work and eventually found the right settings.\n\n\n\nSettings to use\n\n\nI also have a nicer way of setting up the spiderbeam mast using a base clamp wooden block and guy wires attached to a hose clamp with rubber nitrile protecting the mast.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I‚Äôve been enjoying activating SOTA summits on 2m, and after visiting Glas Maol and seeing how far I could get with an omni directional antenna, and watching videos of people using a 2m yagi to get into England from the highlands, I wanted to build a yagi.\nAll my research pointed me towards DK7ZB‚Äôs designs, specifically the lightweight ones. I decided the 4 element design with a 1m boom was optimal between gain and practicalities. This has a gain of 7 dBd and a front to back ratio of 12 dB. It also has the advantage of being able to use it with 70 cms.\n\n\n\nParts to build\n\n\nI went to B&Q and bought some 22mm PVC pipe, some wall clips, 4mm aluminium rods, and a 6mm aluminium tube. I already had some electrical connector blocks and RG58 cable at home. I made the boom a little longer than 1m, so I could hand hold it if I wanted to, otherwise it only needs to be 1m in length.\n\nDimensions from DK7ZB - using 4mm elements\n\n\n\nPositions along boom (mm)\nLength of element (mm)\n\n\n\n\nReflector\n0\n1020\n\n\nRadiator\n260\n977\n\n\nDirector 1\n470\n930\n\n\nDirector 2\n985\n910\n\n\n\nVK1AD‚Äôs post on building a similar yagi helped me decide how to mount everything to the boom, and I set to cutting the aluminium rods and drilling the holes in the clamp. The directors are easy, as they just slide through the clamp as a single piece. The reflector is slightly longer than 1m which the rods come in, so I used the 6mm tube as a connector between two 4mm rods. Sounds good in theory but it‚Äôs tricky to get the rods into the tube - precision hammering needed.\n\n\n\nBest way to drill\n\n\n\n\n\nDriven element\n\n\nThe driven element used the connectors from inside an electrical connector block, zip tied and then glued into one of the clamps. I used some solder wick to attach the coax to and screwed the elements in on each side.\n\n\n\nAttaching coax\n\n\n\n\n\nMore hot glue and amalgamation tape\n\n\n\n\n\nWith choke\n\n\nRG58 is a bit heavy but it‚Äôs all I had so would do. Whilst this was easy to build, it does mean the only way I can transport it is by unscrewing the elements. Not the best solution but I wanted to get it built vs.¬†debating over other ways or buying more things. A common way others do it is with a box mounted on the boom and there‚Äôs a coax connector on it, so you can remove the box with driven element in one. My one has about 3-4m of coax on which is enough from the mast mounting position to having the radio on the ground underneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe length of the driven element is from tip to tip, including the gap in between.\n\n\n\n\n\nPacks up small-ish\n\n\nI marked the PVC tube with sharpie for the location of each clamp, together with numbers. I also put a mark in the centre of the rod on the directors so I could centre it if it moved about in the clamp. It‚Äôs all about 1m long and I found a thin bag to carry it in. It‚Äôs not the greatest but will do. I used bungees to tie it to the side of my backpack.\n\n\n\nTotal weight - including coax\n\n\nI‚Äôm using a SOTABeams tactical mini mast to support it. It‚Äôs 6m telescopic fibreglass pole that has more strength than my usual Carbon-6 mast. There are two conduit wall mounts attached to the boom, so the yagi can be mounted vertically or horizontally. It works well enough, although if I want to change polarisation I have to take the mast down and then put it up again. I could take out all the other sections I don‚Äôt need but if I‚Äôm only taking one mast on an activation I want the 6m in case I need to setup HF.\nI 3D printed some guying rings and rope tensioners from this design and cut some cord to length for the mast. The 2nd lowest ring fitted perfectly on the bottom segment of the tactical mini.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting in the garden\n\n\nFirst test was in the garden, listening to the 2m lunchtime net‚Ä¶so it received well enough.\nThe first outing was to Cairn William, where I‚Äôd set it up on the top. We‚Äôd arranged SSB activity on another summit, although that guy had to pull out, however, we‚Äôd also prepared the locals to listen out. I started with SSB and managed to make four contacts locally with it. I then flipped it to FM and made a few more. Including a nice summit to summit with Schiehallion, around 112 km away! I brought it out later in the day on Tillymorgan, and managed a contact with Helmsdale, around 100 km to the north‚Ä¶whilst the yagi was pointing south! Turning it around turned me from a 53 and a 59 by the chaser\n\n\n\nOn Cairn William\n\n\n\n\n\nOn TIllymorgan\n\n\n\n\n\nLong distance QSOs\n\n\nI‚Äôm pleased with the results and think it worked rather well! It wasn‚Äôt too tricky to setup and use in the field, nor heavy to carry. It takes a bit of getting used to the length of it, especially when walking through forests as I kept catching it on trees and causing them to dump all their water onto my back!\nI think a different way to connect the coax and the driven element would improve it, and maybe a dedicated mast that was just the right length would be better.\nI did find this design for a 100g yagi that looks nice, and have saved a few links to 2m moxon‚Äôs. Not sure when or if I‚Äôll make these, as I do like the convenience of the slim G. I also printed a clip for it, so it doesn‚Äôt flap around in the breeze."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On my last SOTA activiation, a couple of reports said I was off-frequency. At the weekend I setup the KX2 in the garden and arranged for a friend to listen to me and see if I was really off-frequency or if I‚Äôd somehow managed to knock the VFO or turn on XIT etc. on the mountain top and not realise.\n\n\n\nCalibration setting\n\n\nWe had a QSO and he recorded me a few times, once ‚Äúnormally‚Äù with the KX2, once with XIT on and then again using the G90. This was very helpful as I could hear my voice was a little high normally, and so I needed to XIT down. I‚Äôd guessed at 0.5 MHz but that was slightly too much. The G90 QSO was a nice benchmark as well. Whilst I was swapping to the G90 a US station called Micheal and he ended up talking to him for a while! It was Micheal who then suggested that as I‚Äôve got two radios I can just use them to test myself, without having to deal with propagation and everything else!\n\n\n\nCalibration instructions\n\n\nThe KX2 manual details what needs to be done to calibrate the radio. It‚Äôs fairly straight forward to do, but you need a reference frequency in order to calibrate it. This can either be from a signal generator or a known accurate broadcast. A well known one is WWV, the time station from America, which broadcasts on 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 MHz. It announces the time and has a nice carrier to lock onto. I tried listening for WWV but had no luck on any bands. I did think I heard a carrier on 10 MHz and tried to use it to calibrate the radio but that put me wildly off.\nHowever, all is not lost, as you can just manually adjust the reference frequency on the radio via the VFO dial, and that‚Äôs where listening to my own voice is beneficial.\n\n\n\nChecking the bands\n\n\nIt‚Äôs pretty straight forward to do, you put a dummy load on the transceiver you want to transmit from and I just had some wire plugged into the other. Perhaps they‚Äôll both work with dummy loads, or perhaps even no antenna on the receiving station! I found that 40m was fine but 20m and higher frequencies were off by 0.3-0.4 MHz. So I iterated back and forth between changing the reference calibration frequency and then testing my audio again. After a few attempts I was pretty happy and everything sounded good to me.\nIn the end I went from 24,999,380 to 24,999,440. I‚Äôve yet to try it on the air but my tests sounded good to me. I think if I wanted to improve the accuracy, I‚Äôd used CW and then I could lock onto the signal. I might still do that but for now my ‚Äúby ear‚Äù will do."

He was asking when I was going to be doing some higher point summits, as mostly I‚Äôve been doing ones near to the house which don‚Äôt score that high. There are quite a few in my region. After browsing sotl.as some more, I was curious as to how long it took Fraser to reach Mountain Goat. This is the award you get when you reach 1,000 points.\n\n\n\nMM0EFI‚Äôs stats\n\n\nYou can see his activation list on sotl.as, and it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs done a lot of summits and a lot of high pointers. However, the question still remained‚Ä¶how long did it take?\nI know the SOTA database has an API, as several other sites use it and I‚Äôve seen it mentioned in the reflector, but I hadn‚Äôt come across any documentation. Searching around I find this post which gets me started. I work out MM is associationID 03, and then querying https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_roll?associationID=03, I can look up Fraser‚Äôs UserID.\nIn the past I‚Äôve used python to query APIs, put the JSON into a pandas dataframe then calculate and plot things from there. A quick way to get going with this is in Google Colaboratory. It‚Äôs a free jupyter notebook in which many python packages are already installed and it‚Äôs quick to jump in and get going. Unsurprisingly, it now features a LLM AI assistant, where you can just type in what you want and it generates several options of code for you to run and see what happens.\nMy first prompt (including spelling mistakes but now corrected) was:\n\nretreive JSON from api url: https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_log_by_id?year=all&id and create a plot of ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù\n\nOption #2 of Gemini spat out some commented code, I tweaked the date column name, as it just guessed it was called Date not ActivatorDate, and tah-dah ‚ú®\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nurl = \"https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_log_by_id?year=all&id=\"\n\n# Define the ID you want to retrieve data for\nactivator_id = \"46844\"\n\n# Construct the full URL\nfull_url = url + activator_id\n\n# Send the GET request\nresponse = requests.get(full_url)\n\n# Parse the JSON response\ndata = json.loads(response.text)\n\n# Create a Pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert the \"ActivationDate\" column to datetime\ndf[\"ActivationDate\"] = pd.to_datetime(df[\"ActivationDate\"])\n\n# Plot the cumulative sum of \"Total\"\ndf.plot(x=\"ActivationDate\", y=\"Total\", kind=\"line\", figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.title(\"Cumulative Sum of Total for Activator ID: {}\".format(activator_id))\nplt.xlabel(\"Date\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Total\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nThe result!\n\n\nCertainly the trend of a mountain goat! Although I‚Äôd say once he reached 1,000 the pressure was off and you can see that gradient relax.\n\nBut how long did it take?\nThe actual question that was asked\n\nSo I asked Gemini some more questions and we find the answers:\n# prompt: duration in activationdate between start and when total=1000\n\n# Find the first row where Total is greater than or equal to 1000\nfirst_1000_row = df.loc[df[\"Total\"] &gt;= 1000].iloc[0]\n\n# Calculate the duration between the first activation date and the date when Total reached 1000\nduration = first_1000_row[\"ActivationDate\"] - df[\"ActivationDate\"].iloc[0]\n\n# Print the duration\nprint(\"Duration until Total reached 1000:\", duration)\nPlus question #2:\n# prompt: what row of df has total = 1000\n\n# Find the index of the first row where Total is greater than or equal to 1000\nfirst_1000_row_index = df.loc[df[\"Total\"] &gt;= 1000].index[0]\n\n# Print the index\nprint(\"Row index with Total equal to 1000:\", first_1000_row_index)\n\nü•Å633 days and 172 activations üéâ\nI‚Äôm at 16 points right now üòÖ‚õ∞Ô∏èüêê"

    "text": "If you pass your full licence today, you can apply online to get a M0 callsign but you can also apply and get any previously issued prefix. Well, nearly every one. However, it‚Äôs not entirely obvious how to do this. In fact, when I spoke to ofcom about reserving a call or putting a hold on it, the guy said ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry about it, hardly anyone knows how to apply for a G callsign anyway‚Äù. üòÖ\nYou can get all the G# except G2, and they also no longer give out 2 letter callsigns, e.g.¬†G3DX1. You can only get a two letter callsign one is given to you. This is typically if a relative of the original holder (who is now sk) writes a letter or does something that convinces ofcom to give it to you. The original holder doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be a relative of yours, but perhaps the story has to be somewhat more convincing.\nThe process is fairly simple, but it will cost you a one off fee of ¬£20 (compared to free if you get a M0). You fill in the form, email ofcom, wait for a reply in which an invoice is added to your ofcom account (that you‚Äôll have as you‚Äôd have needed it for foundation and intermediate‚Ä¶.unless you never bothered getting those or you did the direct to full exam). You pay the invoice online and your licence is generated immediately! This method can also be used if you want a club callsign that doesn‚Äôt start M0.\nThe form is pretty self-explanatory, but an important thing to note is that you only get to enter three choices of callsign, with the order of preference stated. If those ones aren‚Äôt available, then they‚Äôll assign you a M0 callsign randomly. They don‚Äôt contact you to say those three aren‚Äôt available and would you like to try again. So I‚Äôd recommend calling them (020 7981 3131) before you send in your form to check the availability. Surprisingly, there‚Äôs virtually no wait and they‚Äôre happy to check a few calls, I tried three but sensed more than five and they might get annoyed ‚Äì depends on who you get. You could of course call back another day and try some more.\nThe online application for M0 is great as it immediately tells you if the callsign is available or not, whereas the form you have to call to check. Now there are ways you can check yourself to try and screen things out."

    "text": "What‚Äôs available?\nEvery so often someone does a freedom of information request to ofcom for all the amateur radio licences issued, and they produce a spreadsheet. Searching for this is a quick way to find it, or using the whatdotheyknow website and a search, such as this one against ofcom. This will show you what‚Äôs been taken, and then you can see if someone already has the call you want or not. Plus you can use Excel filtering and formula to check or test calls you are thinking of. Personally, I found these lists to be full of errors, so I‚Äôd recommend a second way to filter down your list of potential calls.\nThis would be via qrz.com. I think the majority of UK amateur radio operators make an account on QRZ. Even if they have absolutely nothing in their profile they probably have one. If you‚Äôre registered, then you can use the wildcard search and then look for profiles to see if someone has the call already. You can use a question mark (?) to match a single wildcard character or star (*) to match multiple characters. The thing to remember is the regional locator in the UK, so whilst G5ALX might look available, I actually have that callsign but my profile is under GM5ALX. Also, ofcom make available sk callsigns after two years‚Ä¶assuming they know the person is silent.\nOf course, phoning them up and asking is the final test, but it‚Äôs best if you‚Äôve got a shortlist prepared already. Assuming they say it‚Äôs available, then away goes your form and welcome to the full licence!\nFuture upgrades to the online system were part of the recent consultation, and so in time this process won‚Äôt be necessary and you can select all the prefixes and see immediately if it‚Äôs available or not. The consultation also suggested they would let people change their callsigns every so often, so maybe you‚Äôll get another shot at it and you whole amateur radio career won‚Äôt all be resting on this decision!"

    "text": "How to pick a callsign?\nThis is all well and good, but how do you choose a callsign in the first place! In some ways the old style of ‚Äúyou get what you‚Äôre given‚Äù takes the pain out of it but it‚Äôs nice having a choice. It‚Äôs a personal preference, but there are a couple of things you might want to consider:\n\nHow does it sound phonetically?\nHow does it sound and what‚Äôs the weight via CW?\n\nSay it out loud a few time, and see if you like the ring of it. There might be some words you don‚Äôt like, or you might want to avoid as in your accent they sound like other words. I find people think I‚Äôm saying papa when I say alpha, which can get annoying, so I might say ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù instead. Mike and Golf are only one syllable, which might seem good but the point of phonetics is to help the listener understand and one syllable only gives them one chance vs.¬†two/three.\nCW wise, I think it‚Äôs worth thinking about even if you don‚Äôt do CW now. You can‚Äôt change you callsign again, and even if we do get the ability later, will you really want to? You get used to things, and sorting out logbooks and QSL cards or even friends you‚Äôve made, all rely on the same callsign. I think it‚Äôs worth considering, even if you still pick you call with a ‚Äúterrible‚Äù CW factor.\nI picked up that letter that end with dit ( . ) aren‚Äôt great as they might get missed, and particularly avoid your callsign ending in B or K or E. If you search about for advice, it seems like there aren‚Äôt any letters left that you should use! You can also calculate the weight of a call, such as on FISTs website, which is a measure of how long it takes to send. Given that we‚Äôre all G(RSL)# and three letters, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a huge variation but maybe it helps differentiate some calls for you.\nThink about when you‚Äôve been on the air and heard others‚Äô callsigns. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve come across some that you think sound good. If you can‚Äôt remember them now, then try and make a note in your log when you do, and see what it is about them you like. I think repetition of letters makes things easier to copy. I‚Äôve heard the DX call out ‚Äúthe delta delta call‚Äù, because it sticks out and instantly memorable.\nThis guy made some slides and a spreadsheet to help you decide. If you‚Äôre an analysis person then you might like it, but try not to spend too long!"

The hardest thing for me is to work out what I want to do. I love reading, talking, listening and watching about what others are doing, and every time I do I learn about another facet that sounds really interesting and something I want to do. The fear I have is that I spend forever looking at what I could do but yet never actually do anything for myself! I have to remind myself that I don‚Äôt need to do everything immediately. I‚Äôve only had a licence since January this year, and I‚Äôve only been on the air for five months!\nI also get daily reminders of how little free time I actually have. I work full time and we have four children ‚â§ 10 years old. I only really have time for one thing each evening ‚Äì which includes writing blog posts! ‚Äì and so I‚Äôm going to use my favourite outliner app, Dynalist, to make a list of all the things I want to do, in order to pick and choose what I should do now and next. It also serves as a place to put useful things I find related to it, although that‚Äôs too organised for me and I‚Äôm more likely to put stuff in my wiki. Actually, I‚Äôm more likely to read something and think I should make a note of it but don‚Äôt. Anyway, it helps focus and stops me spending forever looking at stuff.\nRight now, my tasks are to finish the QO-100 setup, design the garage workshop layout and get it built including the relocation of the shack. But sometimes I‚Äôm tired after work and the kids, and just want to sit on the radio and see who‚Äôs out there.\nWhich leaves me with the thought that even if I built or changed nothing ever again, there are always different people out there to speak to, different propagation patterns and the enjoyment of talking to someone else who also enjoys this hobby.\n\n\n\nI should also finish my other projects I started before getting my licence!"

    "text": "A while ago I managed to pick up a Kenwood D72 from a SK sale for a good price. This is one of the few handhelds that do full duplex, and is also packed with features, including APRS and GPS. This makes it ideal for FM satellites. I recently picked up an Arrow II handheld 2m/70cm antenna to use with it. This is a fairly lightweight dual band yagi, with built in duplexer. All the elements screw together through the boom and so it makes it quick to put away and assemble.\n\n\n\nKenwood radio with Sony voice recorder\n\n\nI do still need to read the D72‚Äôs manual as I was struggling to set up the memories and I think it only works in full duplex in a certain way. I presume A VFO as TX and B as RX but I could be wrong! I also realised the headphones use 2.5mm port and not 3.5mm.\n\n\n\nISS Detector AR View (whilst writing this post)\n\n\nAnyway, I thought I‚Äôd mess about with it at lunch time. I‚Äôve been investigating apps for tracking satellites and to find what‚Äôs coming next. I‚Äôve found ISS Detector with the Amateur radio satellites add-on to be a good option on iOS. I do have to manually add all the birds I want to use. Whilst it shows you the mode, there‚Äôs no filtering for it, and in fact when it shows FM, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a repeater for use. I need to reconcile the list against this tracking site, or this status site.\nIt just so happened that the ISS was in view, and the radio already had the voice frequency saved in the memory. So I started the recorder and tried to get my antenna in the right direction. It didn‚Äôt help that it was where the sun was and so it was hard to read my phone but the AR mode in the ISS Detector app makes it fairly easy to know where to point.\n\nTheodolite app ‚Äì still figuring this out too, but takes nice shots with all the info\nTurns out I was tuning into a planned school contact with Valley Stream South High School in New York state, who were talking with astronaut Andreas Mogensen, KG5GCZ, aboard the ISS. This is their livestream, although not that exciting to watch üòÖ. They had a ham, IK1SLD, who was co-ordinating the radio part and the school were patched in via the internet. His QRZ profile is quite interesting regarding the ISS and the telebridge ground station.\nAs I didn‚Äôt have a 2.5mm jacket for the radio, I balanced the voice recorder on my arm whilst trying to hold the radio, antenna, and phone to see where the ISS was. The pass over me didn‚Äôt last long, maybe 5 minutes max, and I managed to record a couple of minutes of the astronaut‚Äôs answers to the kids questions. Obviously I don‚Äôt hear the kids transmission.\n\n\nMy recording of the transmission. Edited to remove breaks.\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\n\nI ended up having to go and run errands and never got to work anything, but it was fun listening. I also need to sort out the handheld‚Äôs memories and RTFM!\n\n\n\nAndreas Mogensen"

    "text": "My previous attempt ended with just listening to the astronaut, and whilst fun, it wasn‚Äôt what I was actually meant to be doing. I‚Äôve since read the manual and, mostly, figured out the D72. As the radio is quite old there is both lots of info online and also a lack of it, depending on where you like looking. By that I mean there‚Äôs info in email lists but virtually nothing on YouTube! Anyway, with combination of the manual and the Kenwood TH-D72 groups.io, I‚Äôve worked out the essentials.\nThe summary of it all is, you must transmit from VFO B and receive on VFO A, and you have to enable DUP mode through the F(function) button and 0 (zero).\nI‚Äôve got Gpredict on my computer and also ISS Detector app (with the amateur satellites extra) so it was easy to see what was coming up when I had a bit of time this past weekend. Next up was SO-50. My radio already had frequencies stored for SO-50, so I felt confident that I could do this. I keep meaning to add frequencies for most of the FM satellites but I‚Äôve not got round to it yet.\n\nI realise I never took any pictures of my setup, mostly as I had about 8 minutes before the satellite started its pass, so I was in a hurry. The equipment is the D72 radio, my Sony voice recorder, the Arrow antenna and a rats nest of cables. I wanted to record the audio on the voice recorder, I also wanted to use headphones. The D72 has a 2.5mm headphone socket and I don‚Äôt have a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter. However, the fist mic has a 3.5mm headphone out on it, and so I had that plugged into the side, the splitter out the mic with cables to the recorder and my headphones. Phew, what a mess.\nI did find it hard to figure out how to do everything at once. I was using my phone to try and see where the satellite was, I was holding the arrow yagi, I had the radio in my pocket, but also needed to hold the mic, had the voice recorder in my other pocket and headphones on my head.\nLike most people, I only have two hands so I was juggling between everything and couldn‚Äôt find a good process, and struggled to track the satellite very well. I did eventually copy some calls and QSOs on the satellite for a brief period during its 14 minute pass. I‚Äôve edited my recording to just the best parts.\n\n\nBest parts of the pass\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\n\nAt one point I had a lovely clear copy on OH1ON calling, but then it degraded into static and I was only getting weak signals as I mis-aimed the yagi.\nA call I heard was G6UST, and looking at his QRZ page was interesting from satellite tracking. He has a nice picture of a homebrew tracker with PVC pipe and yagis mounted at an angle. Although looks like he‚Äôs moved on since then to a lovely G-5500 az/el rotator.\nOverall some progress, but lots of room for improvements. Even though I didn‚Äôt transmit, I am thinking about how I manage the VFOs and changing frequency to manage doppler on the 70cm side. This means I‚Äôll have to press buttons on the radio to do so, and that‚Äôs not feeling very practical with the fist mic. One option is to skip the mic, get a 2.5 to 3.5mm adapter for the headphones and use the PTT on the radio. This keeps it in my hand and then I can hit the A/B and up/down to manage the frequencies using the memories. Alternatively, Kenwood make a mic with three buttons on the top, the SMC-34, and you can use MCP-4A program to set these buttons. The idea being I can hit A/B, then press up or down, and A/B again ready for transmitting, or just up and down depending on what link 70cms is on.\n\n\n\nConfigure mic keys from the computer software, MCP-4A\n\n\nThe other factor is seeing where the satellite is. The ISS detector app has the AR mode, but I don‚Äôt have a hand left to use it. Thinking either mounting the phone to the arrow antenna, or mounting the antenna on a tripod, and maybe still mounting the phone to the antenna. The tripod also saves me having to hold the antenna the whole time. It is quite light but be nice not to have to hold it, plus it‚Äôs better at keeping still than I am.\nSo a few more improvements and plenty of practice needed. Not sure when I‚Äôll next get out to try, and the weather doesn‚Äôt help. Still interested in building a rotator for satellite work, with elevation as well. Trying to avoid having to buy a G-5500 or equivalent as they‚Äôre very expensive, even used. They‚Äôve been kits over time but they‚Äôve all stopped and probably something like the SatNOGS rotator is a good build but it‚Äôs quite involved for me, plus a lot of 3D printed parts. It would be nice to set something up on the roof, so when it is dark and raining, I can sit inside and still try them out."

He‚Äôd setup a couple of satellite dishes in his garden and had his QO-100 DX Club logo on his profile page, along with some other links. That started me down the rabbit hole. üêáüõ∞Ô∏è\nBriefly, and there‚Äôs more details here, QO-100 is the name given to a geostationary satellite that sits above Africa and has amateur radio transponders. This means it‚Äôs always in the same place, and can be used by amateur radio license holders to make contacts across its coverage. Being in such a high orbit means it has a huge area of coverage, so you can contact anyone in this area and talk to them for hours without the worry of propagation changing and losing contact.\nAnother thing that makes this interesting is that it has both narrow and wide bands. This allows for voice, Morse and simpler digital modes on the narrowband and then on the wide band amateur television! So people can broadcast video via the satellite, there‚Äôs even a weekly net by the British Amateur Television Club (BATC), and they sometimes save them to YouTube. Doing video broadcasting requires a lot more equipment and power, and is maybe a step too far for me.\nThe satellite has been in orbit for about 5 years, so there are a lot of tutorials and guides online on how to get setup, together with people making items that help get connected. The main ones I found useful where DK1MI‚Äôs, M0AWS‚Äôs, and G7IYK‚Äôs Instructables page. My setup is basically the same as DK1MI and G7IYK‚Äôs, which I‚Äôll explain shortly.\nThere seems to be two approaches to getting on the air with QO-100, one is via a SDR that can transmit as well as receive and the other is a transverter that takes you transmitter‚Äôs 2m or 70cm output and ups it to the send frequency. This means you can use a real radio to transmit. You can then either use a SDR for receive or use a downconverter and have your radio be the Rx as well. As I don‚Äôt have a 2m/70cm radio, and the location of my dish is not conducive to using a radio, I went with the SDR option, as that means everything can be housed in a box underneath the dish and all I have to run to it is power and ethernet.\nLike most satellites the uplink and the downlink are on different frequencies, in this case it‚Äôs an uplink of 2.4 GHz (think wifi) and downlink is 10 GHz. The downlink is fairly easy, as a LNB (think Sky dish) can receive it and converts it down to 700 MHz range. This is perfectly fine for most SDR receivers to use. Uplink generally requires some amplification as either the upconverter or the SDR only outputs at very low power‚Ä¶but now we‚Äôre getting too into the detail."

    "title": "QO-100 Build: Part 1 ‚Äì The Design",
    "section": "My Plans",
    "text": "My Plans\nMy in a loose sense of the word as it‚Äôs pretty much copying what many others have already done and figured out. I just found it useful to layout so that I could make sure I had all the right parts, particularly on the power side. I also attempted to figure out the power on the transmit side. Original version here.\n\n\n\nMy QO-100 Schematic\n\n\n\nThe Receive\nYou‚Äôll want a dish. I mooned over a 1.2m dish for a long time, but the price and size meant it was a no go for me. 80 cm seemed a common size for narrowband, and wideband probably wants something bigger than 1.2 anyway. I measured up where I was planning on putting it and 1.2m was probably too big, maybe I could of squeezed in a 1m but 80 cm should be good enough.\nWhen thinking about what dish size, it‚Äôs important to think about the location of it. The satellite is to the south from the UK, near enough the same direction as sky dishes ‚Äì a good guide if you or neighbours have on. You can get dish pointing info from the BATC on their website. So you can drag a pin around to place it exactly where you want it.\nI originally wanted it on a south westerly wall but it probably would‚Äôve ended up being mounted at 90¬∞ and that would mean being at least 40cm off the wall ‚Äì perfect for a gust of wind to rip it off! However, I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a south-ish facing wall at the back of my house and so it was okay to find another location. I also bought a U shaped mount, so it could sit flush to the wall, which helps with wind loading and keeping it out the way.\nThe signal is focused onto a LNB (low-noise block downconverter). According to the internet, the Bullseye LNB is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù one. It‚Äôs fairly cheap, ~¬£30, and stable. In order for it to recieve the signal, a voltage has to be applied for polarisation of the signal. In our case, for the narrowband we need it to be vertically polarised and so applying 12V is what‚Äôs needed. This is done with a handy biased tee, that allows you to inject the voltage to the feed from the LNB, but blocks the DC voltage from continuing on to your recevier. I used satellite cable, the typical f type connector, 75 ohm stuff.\nThat‚Äôs it! The signal then continues to your SDR, in my case the Pluto+ SDR. A cheap SDR like a RTL-SDR or NooElec will do the job. As I said, a(nother) downconverter is an option but not the route I took.\n\n\nPluto+ SDR\nNow‚Äôs a good time to talk about this SDR. First came the Adalm-Pluto by Analog devices. A great SDR which has transmit and recieve and ideal for students and amateurs alike. Many people use this SDR with great success and many have modified it themselves to improve it.\nThe Pluto+ is an upgraded version of Analog device‚Äôs SDR with various improvements available out of the box. Most noticeable are the metal enclosure, the four SMA connections, for two sets of recevie and transmit, a gigabit ethernet connection, a microSD slot, a external clock input on the PCB, and 0.5 ppm TCXO. Probably there are other tweaks too but not things that stood out to me. To me the biggest selling point was the network port and the relative ease at which you can add a GPSDO for stability (not something I had as part of the original plan but a nice blog post from DK1MI again shows how easy it is to add).\nIn my hours of searching and reading forums I recall coming across something like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre building on from scratch go for the Pluto+‚Äù, and so I did. I bought mine from Aliexpress.\nTech Minds has a nice video on it if you want to see more.\n\n\nThe Transmit\nThe Pluto+ SDR has a transmit and can output 2.4 GHz in the region of up to 4 mW, which is great but also not going to get you a contact, and so some amplification is needed. These days it‚Äôs pretty much a standard design to use the Analog Devices CN-0417 amplifier straight out of the SDR and then another one to take it to up to 20 W. It seems like you really only need 10 W with a 80 cm dish to get a strong signal. In fact, if you transmit with too much power you hear a two-tone siren going off called LEILA warning you to turn down. A popular amp is the SG Labs 20W model from Bulgaria, and so that‚Äôs what I picked. 20W seems useful to overcome and losses in connectors and cables.\nWhich brings to me to cables. At 2.4 GHz, losses are high on regular coax (RG58/213) and so you really want some fancier stuff. I went for LMR-400-UF (UF for ultra-flexible to get round corners). It has many layers and is quite something to hold after only ever using RG58 on HF. You also want to keep it as short as possible and so the amplifier needs to be near your dish.\nFinally, the actual feed to the dish. There seems to be two or three styles people use, a ‚ÄúPOTY‚Äù or a helix seem most common. I felt like there were a lot of pieces to this build and so I wasn‚Äôt wanting to build everything myself, I decided to buy an Ice Cone feed from nolle engineering in Germany. This is a helix design, housed in a 3D printed case that looks like a huge ice cream cone. It‚Äôs designed very well and sits on top of the LNB (they even sell adapters for the most common LNBs people use with QO-100).\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a three scoop minimum.\n\n\n\n\nPower\nAll these bits and bobs need power, and at different voltages:\n\nThe biased tee needs 12 V\nThe Pluto+ SDR and CN-0417 need 5 V\nSG Labs PA needs 24-28 V\n\nAgain, as a common build, people have found a common solution, particularly as a lot of people power it from their shack power supply, and everything hangs off a 12 V supply. There are two DC converters, one to 5V with USB sockets for those users and then one that converts to 28V (although is adjustable) from 12V.\nFor me, and the location of my shack and the dish meant I needed an external power supply. Luckily, I have an external power socket within 5m or so of the dish so I just needed to convert it to 12V. In the end I decided upon a Meanwell power brick ‚Äì think laptop brick ‚Äì which gives up to 5A on 12V, this should be more than enough. I also bought a great long kettle lead to plug it in. Going for the brick meant it could sit in my waterproof enclosure with everything else. Plus the 5V DC converter had a pin socket, so I could use the pin from the power supply to power it and then the input pins, which are in parallel, for transferring that 12V on to the other users.\nFor the enclosure I found this on screwfix. It‚Äôs just about big enough. The mounting isn‚Äôt great but works.\n\n\nCost\nIt‚Äôs quite pricey to do this build. Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to list it all here and add it up üòÖ However, as I didn‚Äôt have a 70cm/2m radio this route was probably going to be the cheapest. I could‚Äôve scounged more on items, or tried to find more things used, but insted I bought the parts over about 6 weeks, then when it was only one ¬£100-150 thing a week it didn‚Äôt feel that bad! Ballpark is probably ¬£600-700. I also ended up buying some tools and general items that I didn‚Äôt have, but will be useful for other projects.\n\n\nand finally‚Ä¶\nHave I built it yet? I have, (and maybe why I struggle with tense in this post!) it still has a couple of issues but I‚Äôve made some QSOs. More details in the next part.\n\n\n\nInpromptu dish mounting"

    "text": "The 7th December 2022 I passed my foundation exam online. My invigilator, Bob G0OCB, would also become my full exam invigilator. I had done the Essex ham foundation course in August/September but then put off the exam for a while. I actually only just passed, and probably should‚Äôve just read the manual instead of doing the course. I‚Äôd told a friend I was going to do it, and he ended up passing his exam first, so that spurred me on to take mine.\nSo what have I done in this time? Well my licence didn‚Äôt actually arrive until the beginning of January due to the Christmas holidays and also the postal strikes at the time. That didn‚Äôt really matter as other than my Boafeng handheld, I didn‚Äôt get a radio until April. I was also mic shy and put off speaking to anyone on the handheld, think I listened once or twice to the local nets, but often couldn‚Äôt hear them that well.\nI eventually picked up a Xiegu G90 from the ham radio deals forum, and a 40m EFHW antenna kit, set it up in the garden and overcame my mic shyness to speak with GB2CC, a special event station for HQ Coastal Command. Although looking it up now on QRZ, I see it‚Äôs a new special event for something else. I was just another entry in his log and nothing of significance, whereas for me this was an incredible experience of all these pieces coming together and successfully speaking to someone else. I only managed a since QSO that lunchtime as was meant to be looking after the kids and had left them watching TV for hours. Later that evening I went back on the radio and my second QSO was with Croatia, 9A1CCY, and then my third of the day with someone in England. My first day on the air!\nI then proceeded to go on the air every evening for the following week, even managing a contact with Canada with my 10W. The G90 could tune up the EFHW to any band from 160-10m, and I tried them all out.\nThe following week, I figured out how to get ft8 working on the G90 and all the software and found it interesting seeing who could hear me around the world, even if we didn‚Äôt have a QSO. Although did get some good countries like Angola and Brazil.\nThings continued in a similar fashion as I upgraded to my intermediate. I remember the first few days of getting my callsign all mixed up, between foundation (MM7RVP) and Intermediate (2M0RVM). Around this time I did visit the local club, Aberdeen amateur radio soceity, and knew a very seasoned ham (Allan, GM4ZUK) via a work colleague. The club is‚Ä¶okay‚Ä¶mostly it‚Äôs tricky for me to go to the sessions and the few events they do have, so it‚Äôs hard to break in if you‚Äôre not present. I‚Äôve renewed my membership for 2024 and will see how it goes. I invited myself around to Allan‚Äôs house and he showed me his setup and lovely tower he‚Äôd just had installed. We chatted for a long time and enjoyed the sunny day in his garden in mid-June.\nHe convinced me to get a Diamond V-2000 white stick which does 2m/70cm and also 6m. It was the RSGB 50 MHz Trophy competition the following weekend and Allan was going up the mountain with his trailer mast and big yagis and suggested I have a go. I managed to make four contacts, Allan, plus two Portgual and one Spain. This actually won me the Leading Intermediate Station in the competition, but I think there were only two or three others in the category! My first contest prize!\nI‚Äôve taken part in other contests, mostly just dipping in and out for an hour or so at a time, as I never really had the availability to be there for hours. It‚Äôs quite the endurance activity though, and those operators who do 1000+ QSOs are very impressive.\nSomewhere about this time, I found the ham radio matrix group and have been learning a lot and making new friends via this group. I also joined the OARC Discord and met several great people that way. Whilst I do still want to connect with the local radio enthusiasts, it is just so much easier to do it online.\nIt was only about 2 months of operating as an intermediate before I upgraded to full. I just pushed on and studied for it as I knew I‚Äôd forget some of the things if I didn‚Äôt. I actually found the full exam easier than the intermediate, but maybe the step between the stages isn‚Äôt quite as much, or I was just lucky with the questions. I spent quite a while debating what my final callsign should be, and ended up going with what I first thought of‚Ä¶my name!\nAfter some more HF operation, I became intrigued with QO-100, and eventually pulled the trigger on all the parts to build a station for it. That was my first real project, and it was quite involved! Took me a few months to put it together, mount the dish and get the software going (I‚Äôm still to write up the software setup as part of my blog series on it). However, it‚Äôs been very enjoyable to use and I‚Äôm glad I did it. Although it opened the doors to more potential projects and builds that I want to do!\nThis whole time my radio was setup in the kitchen, with the coax through the window. This was fine during the summer but by about September/October, it was getting too cold to have this setup. I setup a workbench in the garage and now have the radio sat through there with a computer as well. The coax runs around the side of the house and goes in via an air vent. Whilst the beanbag in the corner of the kitchen was quite nice, this proper setup is much better. Although if it‚Äôs windy or very cold outside, the garage can get down to about 8-10¬∞C.\nI had started to try and do LEO satellite operation, and got the radio and handheld yagi setup, but now that it‚Äôs winter, I‚Äôve eased off really doing much outside. I‚Äôve not managed to make a contact this way yet but maybe in the new year.\nI‚Äôve looked at digital radio on and off over the whole time, and generally decided it wasn‚Äôt something I was interested in. However, I do now have a small project ongoing to setup an allstar node but with a tiny Dell Wyse computer and fist mic, so that it‚Äôs like using a real radio but minising the computer part. I didn‚Äôt want to get a digital handheld and a hotspot as I suspect I‚Äôll get bored of it quickly and then have no use for them. At least this way, I can repurpose the computer and the fist mic is always handy to have as a spare. I need to spend some time to figure out the software and configuration, plus find some groups to listen in to."

I‚Äôd also like to get back into some of my other hobbies that I‚Äôve left standing!\nFor 2024, I‚Äôd like to get some LEO satellite QSOs, and maybe even give Greencube MEO a go. I‚Äôve recently bought a 3D printer, and so building my own rotator would be fun to do. Recently, I‚Äôve been chasing SOTA activators at the weekend, and would like to do some activations myself. There are a few summits nearby and would give me a good excuse to try out different wire antenna.

This summer, during our holiday away, I did do about 10 days of LCWO, and got up to copying 10 letters of CW. I immediately stopped when I came home again. Learning CW is on my list, will it be in 2024?
