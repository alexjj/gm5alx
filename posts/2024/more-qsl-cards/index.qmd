A formal looking letter arrived for me this morning, when I looked closely I could see it was from Germany. Inside were some nice QSL cards.

[Micheal](https://dk1mi.radio/about/) has two of his own from our HF SSB, HF FT8 and QO-100 QSOs over the past year, plus then the special one, [DF0MF](https://www.qrz.com/db/DF0MF), from the lightship in Emden. [Micheal describes](https://dk1mi.radio/amrumbank/) his discovery and subsequent visit and activation of this historical ship.

I shall need to QSL, although Micheal's two different cards makes me think about making a new QSL card for my portable SOTA operations. ⛰️

The TH-79E in the background of the photo also arrived today. The battery is dead and I have no power supply for it, and it was sold as "seen" so let's hope a new battery will fix it!
