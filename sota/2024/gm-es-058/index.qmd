Off to the park on the patch of dirt outside the gate into the forest and then up the track. Again, an easy route to follow although the climb up to the summit along the wall, whilst sheltered, is just heather and quite steep in places. Another summit benefitting from a nice wall to shelter behind, I setup again on HF and this time tried 20m.

I had a big pile up on 20m, and whilst I wanted to be packing up at 3pm, I kept saying “QRZ?”! It did eventually die down about 10 past, and I packed up and headed down. The setting sun cast a strange light over the land - my phone camera doesn’t do it justice.
