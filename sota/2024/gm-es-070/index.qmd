Another nice day and another chance for some activiations. After my trip to [Strathfinella](/sota/2024/gm-es-075/) and not doing Garvock on the same day, I was determined to try for two in one day today. So I was more prepared with lunch and routes this time.

First was Hill of Fare. There's a car park called [Back of Hill of Fare](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ERdUMuy4Y7aU9nzL8) on the B993 where there's space for 5-10 cars by the side of a log store. I then followed the path up from there. A couple of new looking fences have been installed but there are some nice gates. They had very high handles, which I thought was strange, but then someone pointed out they're for horse riders.

Probably took around 50-60 minutes to reach the top. It's quite a wide opening at the top, with some small pools of water.

I didn't want to hang about long, so 2M FM got me 3 contacts and then I switched to 70cm to activate the summit. Three people, 4 callsigns and 2 bands in about 10 minutes! Time to go to the next one, and hopefully arrive in time to catch Chris, MM7RVP, going up Cairn-mon-earn for a summit to summit contact.
