    "text": "My previous attempt ended with just listening to the astronaut, and whilst fun, it wasn‚Äôt what I was actually meant to be doing. I‚Äôve since read the manual and, mostly, figured out the D72. As the radio is quite old there is both lots of info online and also a lack of it, depending on where you like looking. By that I mean there‚Äôs info in email lists but virtually nothing on YouTube! Anyway, with combination of the manual and the Kenwood TH-D72 groups.io, I‚Äôve worked out the essentials.\nThe summary of it all is, you must transmit from VFO B and receive on VFO A, and you have to enable DUP mode through the F(function) button and 0 (zero).\nI‚Äôve got Gpredict on my computer and also ISS Detector app (with the amateur satellites extra) so it was easy to see what was coming up when I had a bit of time this past weekend. Next up was SO-50. My radio already had frequencies stored for SO-50, so I felt confident that I could do this. I keep meaning to add frequencies for most of the FM satellites but I‚Äôve not got round to it yet.\n\nI realise I never took any pictures of my setup, mostly as I had about 8 minutes before the satellite started its pass, so I was in a hurry. The equipment is the D72 radio, my Sony voice recorder, the Arrow antenna and a rats nest of cables. I wanted to record the audio on the voice recorder, I also wanted to use headphones. The D72 has a 2.5mm headphone socket and I don‚Äôt have a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter. However, the fist mic has a 3.5mm headphone out on it, and so I had that plugged into the side, the splitter out the mic with cables to the recorder and my headphones. Phew, what a mess.\nI did find it hard to figure out how to do everything at once. I was using my phone to try and see where the satellite was, I was holding the arrow yagi, I had the radio in my pocket, but also needed to hold the mic, had the voice recorder in my other pocket and headphones on my head.\nLike most people, I only have two hands so I was juggling between everything and couldn‚Äôt find a good process, and struggled to track the satellite very well. I did eventually copy some calls and QSOs on the satellite for a brief period during its 14 minute pass. I‚Äôve edited my recording to just the best parts.\n\n\nBest parts of the pass\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\n\nAt one point I had a lovely clear copy on OH1ON calling, but then it degraded into static and I was only getting weak signals as I mis-aimed the yagi.\nA call I heard was G6UST, and looking at his QRZ page was interesting from satellite tracking. He has a nice picture of a homebrew tracker with PVC pipe and yagis mounted at an angle. Although looks like he‚Äôs moved on since then to a lovely G-5500 az/el rotator.\nOverall some progress, but lots of room for improvements. Even though I didn‚Äôt transmit, I am thinking about how I manage the VFOs and changing frequency to manage doppler on the 70cm side. This means I‚Äôll have to press buttons on the radio to do so, and that‚Äôs not feeling very practical with the fist mic. One option is to skip the mic, get a 2.5 to 3.5mm adapter for the headphones and use the PTT on the radio. This keeps it in my hand and then I can hit the A/B and up/down to manage the frequencies using the memories. Alternatively, Kenwood make a mic with three buttons on the top, the SMC-34, and you can use MCP-4A program to set these buttons. The idea being I can hit A/B, then press up or down, and A/B again ready for transmitting, or just up and down depending on what link 70cms is on.\n\n\n\nConfigure mic keys from the computer software, MCP-4A\n\n\nThe other factor is seeing where the satellite is. The ISS detector app has the AR mode, but I don‚Äôt have a hand left to use it. Thinking either mounting the phone to the arrow antenna, or mounting the antenna on a tripod, and maybe still mounting the phone to the antenna. The tripod also saves me having to hold the antenna the whole time. It is quite light but be nice not to have to hold it, plus it‚Äôs better at keeping still than I am.\nSo a few more improvements and plenty of practice needed. Not sure when I‚Äôll next get out to try, and the weather doesn‚Äôt help. Still interested in building a rotator for satellite work, with elevation as well. Trying to avoid having to buy a G-5500 or equivalent as they‚Äôre very expensive, even used. They‚Äôve been kits over time but they‚Äôve all stopped and probably something like the SatNOGS rotator is a good build but it‚Äôs quite involved for me, plus a lot of 3D printed parts. It would be nice to set something up on the roof, so when it is dark and raining, I can sit inside and still try them out."

    "text": "It‚Äôs both a blessing and a curse that amateur radio has so many different facets and parts‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt even begin to list them all: antennas, operating frequencies, circuitry, radios, modes of operation, amplifiers, structures, networks, digital, analog, moon bounce, competitions, prizes, collecting, ‚Ä¶ and even each of those sections has subsections or intersections of sections üòÖ It truly is a hobby for life.\n\n\n\nBetter start young then\n\n\nThis isn‚Äôt meant to sound like complaining, more of an expression of overwhelming amazement. The hardest thing for me is to work out what I want to do. I love reading, talking, listening and watching about what others are doing, and every time I do I learn about another facet that sounds really interesting and something I want to do. The fear I have is that I spend forever looking at what I could do but yet never actually do anything for myself! I have to remind myself that I don‚Äôt need to do everything immediately. I‚Äôve only had a licence since January this year, and I‚Äôve only been on the air for five months!\nI also get daily reminders of how little free time I actually have. I work full time and we have four children ‚â§ 10 years old. I only really have time for one thing each evening ‚Äì which includes writing blog posts! ‚Äì and so I‚Äôm going to use my favourite outliner app, Dynalist, to make a list of all the things I want to do, in order to pick and choose what I should do now and next. It also serves as a place to put useful things I find related to it, although that‚Äôs too organised for me and I‚Äôm more likely to put stuff in my wiki. Actually, I‚Äôm more likely to read something and think I should make a note of it but don‚Äôt. Anyway, it helps focus and stops me spending forever looking at stuff.\nRight now, my tasks are to finish the QO-100 setup, design the garage workshop layout and get it built including the relocation of the shack. But sometimes I‚Äôm tired after work and the kids, and just want to sit on the radio and see who‚Äôs out there.\nWhich leaves me with the thought that even if I built or changed nothing ever again, there are always different people out there to speak to, different propagation patterns and the enjoyment of talking to someone else who also enjoys this hobby.\n\n\n\nI should also finish my other projects I started before getting my licence!"

    "text": "Feed point of random wire with 9:1 unun\n\n\nFor some reason, I tend to avoid trying out 15 meters, but yesterday I decided to give it a shot, and it went quite well. I began by experimenting with my 39.5-meter random wire antenna in the garden. It has excellent reception, and I could hear approximately 20 Japanese stations. However, when it came to transmitting, it didn‚Äôt perform as well as expected. I thought that the higher frequency of 15 meters might compensate for its low height, but according to pskreporter, it seemed that no one was receiving my signals. While I believe I managed to make a few QSOs, I eventually wanted to move indoors. The random wire is just a temporary setup, and I have to sit outside to use it.\n\n\n\nFar field plot at 15m on my random wire\n\n\nI switched back to using my EFHW (End-Fed Half-Wave) antenna, which still provided good reception. Being positioned at about 8 meters in height, it was much more effective for transmitting. My radio is currently set up in the kitchen, and I sit on the floor with a beanbag while operating it. I‚Äôm currently (or at least I like to think I am) in the process of designing a new workbench or shack in the garage. I‚Äôve also been contemplating the idea of remote operation. I wanted to continue designing my garage setup, but at the same time, I was making numerous FT8 contacts with desirable DX countries. Given that I‚Äôm using a Windows laptop with the radio, an obvious solution is the Remote Desktop Connection application. I‚Äôm not sure why I didn‚Äôt try it earlier. The only thing I needed to check was the audio settings, as the default settings would route the remote computer‚Äôs audio to me, causing WSJT-X to lose access to the soundcard. However, it‚Äôs a simple fix in the options to prevent this.\n\n\n\nAudio on remote computer\n\n\nWith that sorted out, WSJT-X and Grid Tracker could occupy one screen while I worked on the other comfortably from my desk. WSJT-X doesn‚Äôt have all the CAT commands required, so if I needed to adjust more settings on the radio, I‚Äôd have to use another program. I‚Äôm also unsure if CAT can control everything on the FT-DX10, such as the preset option I use for digital modes. For the time being, that‚Äôs acceptable since it‚Äôs just across the house.\nLast night, 15 meters, with occasional forays into 17 meters, turned out to be quite successful for me. There were instances of signal fading, and sometimes it took a while to receive a ‚ÄúRR73‚Äù reply from the other station, so whether or not everyone will log the QSOs depends on their perspective. Nonetheless, from my standpoint, we successfully exchanged signal reports.\n\n\n\nMap of world with spots showing QSOs\n\n\nI also found pskreporter not very reliable, as it would often show only two stations hearing me when I‚Äôd then get multiple replies to my CQ."

    "text": "The 7th December 2022 I passed my foundation exam online. My invigilator, Bob G0OCB, would also become my full exam invigilator. I had done the Essex ham foundation course in August/September but then put off the exam for a while. I actually only just passed, and probably should‚Äôve just read the manual instead of doing the course. I‚Äôd told a friend I was going to do it, and he ended up passing his exam first, so that spurred me on to take mine.\nSo what have I done in this time? Well my licence didn‚Äôt actually arrive until the beginning of January due to the Christmas holidays and also the postal strikes at the time. That didn‚Äôt really matter as other than my Boafeng handheld, I didn‚Äôt get a radio until April. I was also mic shy and put off speaking to anyone on the handheld, think I listened once or twice to the local nets, but often couldn‚Äôt hear them that well.\nI eventually picked up a Xiegu G90 from the ham radio deals forum, and a 40m EFHW antenna kit, set it up in the garden and overcame my mic shyness to speak with GB2CC, a special event station for HQ Coastal Command. Although looking it up now on QRZ, I see it‚Äôs a new special event for something else. I was just another entry in his log and nothing of significance, whereas for me this was an incredible experience of all these pieces coming together and successfully speaking to someone else. I only managed a since QSO that lunchtime as was meant to be looking after the kids and had left them watching TV for hours. Later that evening I went back on the radio and my second QSO was with Croatia, 9A1CCY, and then my third of the day with someone in England. My first day on the air!\nI then proceeded to go on the air every evening for the following week, even managing a contact with Canada with my 10W. The G90 could tune up the EFHW to any band from 160-10m, and I tried them all out.\nThe following week, I figured out how to get ft8 working on the G90 and all the software and found it interesting seeing who could hear me around the world, even if we didn‚Äôt have a QSO. Although did get some good countries like Angola and Brazil.\nThings continued in a similar fashion as I upgraded to my intermediate. I remember the first few days of getting my callsign all mixed up, between foundation (MM7RVP) and Intermediate (2M0RVM). Around this time I did visit the local club, Aberdeen amateur radio soceity, and knew a very seasoned ham (Allan, GM4ZUK) via a work colleague. The club is‚Ä¶okay‚Ä¶mostly it‚Äôs tricky for me to go to the sessions and the few events they do have, so it‚Äôs hard to break in if you‚Äôre not present. I‚Äôve renewed my membership for 2024 and will see how it goes. I invited myself around to Allan‚Äôs house and he showed me his setup and lovely tower he‚Äôd just had installed. We chatted for a long time and enjoyed the sunny day in his garden in mid-June.\nHe convinced me to get a Diamond V-2000 white stick which does 2m/70cm and also 6m. It was the RSGB 50 MHz Trophy competition the following weekend and Allan was going up the mountain with his trailer mast and big yagis and suggested I have a go. I managed to make four contacts, Allan, plus two Portgual and one Spain. This actually won me the Leading Intermediate Station in the competition, but I think there were only two or three others in the category! My first contest prize!\nI‚Äôve taken part in other contests, mostly just dipping in and out for an hour or so at a time, as I never really had the availability to be there for hours. It‚Äôs quite the endurance activity though, and those operators who do 1000+ QSOs are very impressive.\nSomewhere about this time, I found the ham radio matrix group and have been learning a lot and making new friends via this group. I also joined the OARC Discord and met several great people that way. Whilst I do still want to connect with the local radio enthusiasts, it is just so much easier to do it online.\nIt was only about 2 months of operating as an intermediate before I upgraded to full. I just pushed on and studied for it as I knew I‚Äôd forget some of the things if I didn‚Äôt. I actually found the full exam easier than the intermediate, but maybe the step between the stages isn‚Äôt quite as much, or I was just lucky with the questions. I spent quite a while debating what my final callsign should be, and ended up going with what I first thought of‚Ä¶my name!\nAfter some more HF operation, I became intrigued with QO-100, and eventually pulled the trigger on all the parts to build a station for it. That was my first real project, and it was quite involved! Took me a few months to put it together, mount the dish and get the software going (I‚Äôm still to write up the software setup as part of my blog series on it). However, it‚Äôs been very enjoyable to use and I‚Äôm glad I did it. Although it opened the doors to more potential projects and builds that I want to do!\nThis whole time my radio was setup in the kitchen, with the coax through the window. This was fine during the summer but by about September/October, it was getting too cold to have this setup. I setup a workbench in the garage and now have the radio sat through there with a computer as well. The coax runs around the side of the house and goes in via an air vent. Whilst the beanbag in the corner of the kitchen was quite nice, this proper setup is much better. Although if it‚Äôs windy or very cold outside, the garage can get down to about 8-10¬∞C.\nI had started to try and do LEO satellite operation, and got the radio and handheld yagi setup, but now that it‚Äôs winter, I‚Äôve eased off really doing much outside. I‚Äôve not managed to make a contact this way yet but maybe in the new year.\nI‚Äôve looked at digital radio on and off over the whole time, and generally decided it wasn‚Äôt something I was interested in. However, I do now have a small project ongoing to setup an allstar node but with a tiny Dell Wyse computer and fist mic, so that it‚Äôs like using a real radio but minising the computer part. I didn‚Äôt want to get a digital handheld and a hotspot as I suspect I‚Äôll get bored of it quickly and then have no use for them. At least this way, I can repurpose the computer and the fist mic is always handy to have as a spare. I need to spend some time to figure out the software and configuration, plus find some groups to listen in to."

I‚Äôd also like to get back into some of my other hobbies that I‚Äôve left standing!\nFor 2024, I‚Äôd like to get some LEO satellite QSOs, and maybe even give Greencube MEO a go. I‚Äôve recently bought a 3D printer, and so building my own rotator would be fun to do. Recently, I‚Äôve been chasing SOTA activators at the weekend, and would like to do some activations myself. There are a few summits nearby and would give me a good excuse to try out different wire antenna. Speaking of which, I‚Äôd still like to try and setup something else at home, perhaps a vertical, or some hexbeam/yagi/moxon arrangement for a few of the higher bands to see if the bit of gain helps get some further contacts via SSB vs.¬†just ft8. This summer, during our holiday away, I did do about 10 days of LCWO, and got up to copying 10 letters of CW. I immediately stopped when I came home again. Learning CW is on my list, will it be in 2024? I suspect not, but we‚Äôll see.\nWell that list is already starting to seem like a lot of things, and having some balance is already starting to tip towards amateur radio!

    "text": "My first radio was the Xiegu G90, and when I bought my Yaesu FT-DX10 I decided I‚Äôd keep the G90 for portable operations. It‚Äôs pretty small, 20W, and I already have it and know how it works. With a few days planned to stay near Aviemore in the summer holidays I thought it was the perfect time to try it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA converted church was our accommodation for the trip. Very fancy!\n\n\nI have a 6m telescopic pole and decided to make a vertical antenna with it. In an effort to keep it simple, I went for a 1/4 wave for 20m with some radials and a 1:1 choke wrapping the coax around a torroid.\nI‚Äôd left making the antenna until the night before we were due to go and so it was a bit of a rush to make it! I cut the wire considerably longer as I didn‚Äôt want to try and be too smart on my first attempt, and would use the NanoVNA to cut it to the right length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat too long!\n\n\nI think this worked against me as I ended up cutting it many times and then got sloppy and rushed, which meant I went from a 1.1 SWR at 14.035 MHz to 1.07 at 14.385 MHz..oops! By this time it was 9pm and I was meant to be packing other things. So I took the bit of wire I cut off and figured I‚Äôd reattach it later. I had also cut 5x 5m ish radials, and was using a dipole connector I had for the coax to wire connections.\nWe were staying with friends who were interested in hearing about amateur radio and why I was doing it, particularly when I set everything up outside. I tried not to blah on too much‚Ä¶\nOur house backed onto the forest and there was no boundary between the garden ending and the forest starting, so I just setup near the bench and had the antenna towards the trees and out the way of running kids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup at the holiday house\n\n\nAs well as my first time portable, it was my first time with a vertical and I was interested in how it performed compared to my horizontal EFHW I have at home. This is where I really like FT8 and pskreporter. Regardless of QSOs I make, I can see who hears me and I can obviously see who I hear.\nI immediately noticed how many ZL stations I could hear, far more than I‚Äôve ever had before. I think at home I‚Äôve maybe seen one very briefly, but now I was seeing 5-8 stations for several hours in the morning. In fact I saw countries from all over the world that I‚Äôve rarely heard before, it was like a deluxe buffet of locations!\nMy hastily cut and then reattached wire wasn‚Äôt the greatest, the G90 could tune it on 20m and several other bands but I kept it on 20m as I didn‚Äôt have that long to play in the radio and this should be the least worst band for it! Nevertheless, it worked and I was heard all around the world.\n\n\n\nWho‚Äôs listening?\n\n\nI made about 17 contacts that day, in the morning and then a little in the afternoon. A variety of European countries, including a couple of portable stations in Slovenia and Belgium, and also a contact in Oklahoma state. I listened in on SSB but didn‚Äôt get round to making any contacts on voice.\nAll in all, I was pleased with my first go, plenty of things to improve on next time and maybe try a different vertical, perhaps an end fed or just a better job cutting it! I do also want to get a bigger pole to move up to half wave territory. I‚Äôm not hiking up mountains so weight isn‚Äôt a huge factor, and I‚Äôm thinking of taking it down to the sea one time and seeing if the salt water helps me reach the exotic locations!\n\n\n\nTesting in the garden"

    "text": "After my double activation yesterday (which I‚Äôve yet to write up), I bumped into Fraser, MM0EFI of RadioRover YouTube fame, in Tesco. He was asking when I was going to be doing some higher point summits, as mostly I‚Äôve been doing ones near to the house which don‚Äôt score that high. There are quite a few in my region. After browsing sotl.as some more, I was curious as to how long it took Fraser to reach Mountain Goat. This is the award you get when you reach 1,000 points.\n\n\n\nMM0EFI‚Äôs stats\n\n\nYou can see his activation list on sotl.as, and it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs done a lot of summits and a lot of high pointers. However, the question still remained‚Ä¶how long did it take?\nI know the SOTA database has an API, as several other sites use it and I‚Äôve seen it mentioned in the reflector, but I hadn‚Äôt come across any documentation. Searching around I find this post which gets me started. I work out MM is associationID 03, and then querying https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_roll?associationID=03, I can look up Fraser‚Äôs UserID.\nIn the past I‚Äôve used python to query APIs, put the JSON into a pandas dataframe then calculate and plot things from there. A quick way to get going with this is in Google Colaboratory. It‚Äôs a free jupyter notebook in which many python packages are already installed and it‚Äôs quick to jump in and get going. Unsurprisingly, it now features a LLM AI assistant, where you can just type in what you want and it generates several options of code for you to run and see what happens.\nMy first prompt (including spelling mistakes but now corrected) was:\n\nretreive JSON from api url: https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_log_by_id?year=all&id and create a plot of ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù\n\nOption #2 of Gemini spat out some commented code, I tweaked the date column name, as it just guessed it was called Date not ActivatorDate, and tah-dah ‚ú®\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nurl = \"https://api-db.sota.org.uk/admin/activator_log_by_id?year=all&id=\"\n\n# Define the ID you want to retrieve data for\nactivator_id = \"46844\"\n\n# Construct the full URL\nfull_url = url + activator_id\n\n# Send the GET request\nresponse = requests.get(full_url)\n\n# Parse the JSON response\ndata = json.loads(response.text)\n\n# Create a Pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert the \"ActivationDate\" column to datetime\ndf[\"ActivationDate\"] = pd.to_datetime(df[\"ActivationDate\"])\n\n# Plot the cumulative sum of \"Total\"\ndf.plot(x=\"ActivationDate\", y=\"Total\", kind=\"line\", figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.title(\"Cumulative Sum of Total for Activator ID: {}\".format(activator_id))\nplt.xlabel(\"Date\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Total\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nThe result!\n\n\nCertainly the trend of a mountain goat! Although I‚Äôd say once he reached 1,000 the pressure was off and you can see that gradient relax.\n\nBut how long did it take?\nThe actual question that was asked\n\nSo I asked Gemini some more questions and we find the answers:\n# prompt: duration in activationdate between start and when total=1000\n\n# Find the first row where Total is greater than or equal to 1000\nfirst_1000_row = df.loc[df[\"Total\"] &gt;= 1000].iloc[0]\n\n# Calculate the duration between the first activation date and the date when Total reached 1000\nduration = first_1000_row[\"ActivationDate\"] - df[\"ActivationDate\"].iloc[0]\n\n# Print the duration\nprint(\"Duration until Total reached 1000:\", duration)\nPlus question #2:\n# prompt: what row of df has total = 1000\n\n# Find the index of the first row where Total is greater than or equal to 1000\nfirst_1000_row_index = df.loc[df[\"Total\"] &gt;= 1000].index[0]\n\n# Print the index\nprint(\"Row index with Total equal to 1000:\", first_1000_row_index)\n\nü•Å633 days and 172 activations üéâ\nI‚Äôm at 16 points right now üòÖ‚õ∞Ô∏èüêê"

    "text": "I‚Äôve chased a few SOTA activators before, it‚Äôs quite a fun thing to do, you watch the spotting website and then see if you can get them. Once someone posts a spot it‚Äôs pretty quick for them to get a pile up. I‚Äôve kept thinking about doing it, and I do live in an ideal place where there are plenty of summits to chose from. I‚Äôve not been on the radio much this year and I ended up taking a day off today to drop off and pick up the kids from school, so I decided I should make the most of it and go up a mountain!\nUsing the great SOTA map website, Sotlas, I had a look around to see where I should go first. As I was doing the school run, I was limited on time to about 6 hours all in. I also thought I shouldn‚Äôt try too much on my first attempt, in both walking and radio setup. I noticed that some summits get bonus points during the winter (between about December and March), and one of those was near me so I thought that would be ideal. The place is called Bennachie, and one of its highest peaks is Oxen Craig. The peaks are call a ‚Äòtap‚Äô. This is the summit GM/ES-061, which is worth two points and five in the winter.\nAs you can see from this photo taken by MM7MWL, it‚Äôs a beautiful view."

    "text": "Gear\nRadio-wise, I still have my Xiegu G90, which was my first radio, that is portable enough ‚Äì certainly when compared to the Yaesu FTDX10! It‚Äôs got a bit of heft to it (2.5 kg üò∞), but is 20W, has a great ATU and a nice waterfall.\nFor the antenna, I wanted to keep it as simple as possible and to make use of my carbon 6m mast. I found MM0EFI‚Äôs random wire suggestion and it looked ideal. This is 5.5m radiator, with two 4.25m counterpoises. They‚Äôre attached via bananaplugs to a BNC, then a short piece of coax with a common mode choke into the radio.\nThe battery situation isn‚Äôt ideal. I‚Äôm using an ultramax 18 Ah LiFePO4 battery, which has loads of capacity and much better than a lead acid or a LiPo one but it‚Äôs still around 2.5 kg. I use it when out in the garden, but have never had to carry it very far. I do have a few 18650 lithium cells which I‚Äôm meaning to make my own portable battery but I‚Äôve not got round to it yet. So the ultramax had to do.\nI also brought my Boafeng 2m/70cm radio to try some 2m FM. I have a Kenwood TH-D72, which I thought of bringing for APRS, but it‚Äôs too complex for my liking. Plus I could‚Äôve just used my phone for APRS if I really wanted to.\nAll in, with lunch and water, my backpack was over 6 kg. Fine, but plenty of room for optimisation next time."

    "text": "The Activation\nWith the kids dropped off at school, and backpack packed, I set off about 0915 to drive to the car park behind the summit.\n\n\n\nAt the car park\n\n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure how long everything was going to take, so I opted to find the shortest and most direct route to the summit. There are quite a few walks you can do in the area via various taps and approach from different sides, but starting at the ‚Äúback‚Äù looked the quickest. It was basically a straight up.\nI had looked at doing two activations in one trip, as Millstone Hill, GM/ES-077, isn‚Äôt that far away. However, when I worked out a couple of routes they were 4-5 hours of walking and I decided that was trying to do too much in one day.\n\n\n\nRoute planned on OS Maps\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight up 350m over 2.2km (or 1,150 ft over 1.4 miles)\n\n\nI paid my parking at 0953, and was being blown away on the summit by 1040, which was a bit quicker than the 1:08 hrs OSMaps suggested it would take to walk up. I was pretty hot and sweaty by the time I got to the top, and had taken off my hat, but once exposed in the wind, I was glad to have it.\n\n\n\nLooking North\n\n\n\n\n\nUp we go\n\n\n\nIt was quite nice weather on the way up, I could see the summits were under cloud cover, and when I reached the top the wind was howling and the air was very cold.\n\n\n\nCloud\n\n\n\n\n\nView from the top\n\n\nI looked around for a nice place to setup, and ate my sandwich. Another guy came up and we said hello. I tried a few calls on 145.500 MHz, but I think I would‚Äôve needed to organise this ahead of time with the locals. I found a nice outcrop to shelter behind that was in front of the summit, and setup the pole and radio on a rock. I had a little nook to crouch in and there I started to see if I could make any contacts.\n\n\n\nRadio Setup\n\n\nI started on 40m, had a listen to 10m, but it seemed dead, then moved to 15m and then finally 20m. I managed 37 contacts, with 14 countries, two summit to summit QSOs, and one parks on the air contact. My furthest contact was with Z36T in The Republic of North Macedonia at 1501 miles.\n\n\n\nMap (partial) from SOTA database\n\n\nI‚Äôd been on the air 50 minutes and my logging hand was getting cold! Plus I was getting stiff in my funny crouching position, and concious of getting back in time to pick up the kids. I was using Cloudlogoffline app to log, which is handy as it can then sync to my cloudlog database but I don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt keep the frequency from the previous QSO as the default entry. [update: you can under the settings, so set it there before starting to add QSOs.] It‚Äôs also fiddly to add another SOTA reference due to the iOS keyboard coming up when you select an input box and not being able to scroll. I might just do ‚ÄòFast Log Entry‚Äô (FLE) next time in an Apple note file. I‚Äôll see what else there is too. VK port-a-log seems to be a favourite for SOTA but it‚Äôs Android only.\nI was back in time for a nice cup of tea and sit down before it was school pick up. I look forward to the next one. It‚Äôs fun being the DX! üìª‚õ∞Ô∏è"

    "text": "After my first summit, I was keen to go again. I didn‚Äôt get much opportunity for a few weeks but then one Friday I was off work and it was a glorious day so it seemed like the perfect opportunity. The route in Sotlas was the one I took. There‚Äôs a small car park at the start of the route near Knockburn Loch - a favourite place for paddle boarding and other lake activities. The start is a dirt road that the loggers and farmers use and so an easy walk gently uphill.\n\n\n\nView of the summit from the road\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn right here! ‚û°Ô∏è\n\n\nOnce you start getting into the forest part you turn off the road and onto a track. The weather had been quite wet and there was evidence of run off washing away a lot of the path up. It was like walking on a dry river bed!\n\n\n\nPath or river bed?\n\n\nThe gradient picks up in the forest area and then you emerge around 400m up looking up to the summit and across to the south, where there‚Äôs a wind farm on the side of the hill. The walk from here continues up and round to the summit. I had blue skies and a bit of haze in the distance but great views all round.\n\n\n\nWindfarm\n\n\n\n\n\nNot far to the top\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking East\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the summit\n\n\nThis time I had a much lighter pack with me. I‚Äôd been lucky in find a used KX2, and it is considerably lighter than my G90 plus huge battery! I have it tucked into a little LowePro camera case and I printed a front cover to protect it whilst in transit. I was using the short random wire vertical as before. This is a 5.5m radiator, with two 4.25m counterpoises. They‚Äôre attached via bananaplugs to a BNC, then a short piece of coax with a common mode choke into the radio. I also had my Boafeng for 2m FM.\n\n\n\nEssentials\n\n\nI got 3 on 2m FM from Aberdeen and shire, then setup on HF. Where the G90 can tune the antenna on 40m, the KX2 can‚Äôt - not without a helper transformer. So I went straight to 20m, where I managed another 10 contacts. The highlight being JW9DSA from Svalbard. I didn‚Äôt know where JW was at the time and he was a very strong signal, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. He did keep saying ‚Äúhello from the artic‚Äù, and thanking me for the SOTA activation. I sort of assumed it was Russian somewhere. When I got home I looked him up and saw where and what they were up to! He wasn‚Äôt on a summit at the time, just in the camp calling others. A good contact at around 1,500 miles, and makes the map look bigger!\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nI‚Äôd also tried out the tiny mic for the first time. I assumed it worked okay as no-one said anything untowards. I also had the audio repeat (I forget the proper term), so I could hear myself and it seemed fine to me also. It was back down and back home. I was hot by the time I got back as the weather was warm and it was sunny. Had a nice cup of tea at home, looked at the logs and then it was time to pick the kids up from school!\n\n\n\nTiny Mic in action\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward to the next one!"

    "text": "It‚Äôs the summer holidays and so the kids are home all the time, or we‚Äôre away etc. and I didn‚Äôt think I would get to do very much SOTA during the holidays. However, today the younger ones were off on a play date with some friends, so that just left my eldest and I at home. Left to her own devices she would spend all her time on devices! So I figured we should go climb a hill!\nMy usual research method of browsing the sotlas map and asking the WhatsApp group led to Craiglich with the prospect of a tea room afterwards. The tea room was the real winner here. üç∞\n\n\n\nPath to the top\n\n\nThere‚Äôs a small car park on the north side of the road and after climbing a rickerty gate, we were off!\n\n\n\nHappy to start\n\n\nThe path starts along through a field and then enters the forest. It‚Äôs a little wet and boggy at first, but nothing major. The pathway is quite narrow with heather and pines growing close by. I was wearing shorts and was beginning to regret that idea on the grounds of tick risk! Although I managed the whole walk without any incident.\n\n\n\nThrough the forest\n\n\nThere‚Äôs only one real turn that you have to look for in the forest, where you bear to the left to climb the hill. At this point it‚Äôs a little steeper but overall the path is gentle and very pleasant. You come out of the forest into the open area with nice purple heather covering the hillside. I‚Äôd recently bought Sotagoat app, so my daugther was using it to track the summit. It‚Äôs a convenient app for finding the summit and telling you when you‚Äôre in the activation area. It offers an offline database too, so you can find information without phone reception, and finally spotting is easy from it. Probably does more but I‚Äôve not looked into it too much yet.\nWe reached the top and I setup my slim G on the mast on the cairn, with the D72 and called CQ on 2m FM. I spoke to the locals, including Chris, MM7RVC, who‚Äôd literally just completed his intermediate exam and had passed. So we all congratulated him on that! I also spoke with Bruce, MM6BWS, who was a new local contact for me.\n\nI did hear another station on a summit, and heard him having a QSO with MM7MOX (Andy), although I couldn‚Äôt hear Andy. Looking at MM7MOX‚Äôs activations and logs, he was on Torlum (GM/SS-227) at the time I think it must‚Äôve been Lee, MM7LEF/P, on Scald Law (GM/SS-125) that I could hear. He was working 2m FM at exactly the time I could hear him as it was interrupting my chat with Bruce. Pretty amazing as it‚Äôs almost 150 km away and there are big hills between us. Aircraft scatter? I don‚Äôt know, I should email him!\n\n\n\nThat is quite the distance!\n\n\nI got my four and this trip was not about contacts, so we packed and headed down the hill in preparation for the best part of the trip!\nWe were going to go to Tarland tea room but when I looked at the map I saw there was one in Lumphanan and that was on our route home, so seemed a better choice. Alas! it proved no good as they only took cash and I had none. The nearest cash machine was miles away and, being a Sunday, the local post office was shut. That was a shame as it looked a lovely little tea room. So we continued on into Banchory and found somewhere there. The Birdhouse cafe. It was fine - a bit too hipster coffee house for me but I had a cup of tea and my daugther a can of diet coke.\nOur other task was to find some jam sugar after our strawberry picking, and it seems the only store in Aberdeenshire that had any was the Morrisons in Banchory - whilst it was the last shop we visited it wasn‚Äôt the first!\n\n\n\nHappy smiles all round\n\n\nMaybe we‚Äôll manage another in the holidays‚Ä¶and I‚Äôll have to be better prepared on the tea shop side!"

Space for maybe 5 cars here. You walk across the field and past an abandoned house. As you go through the gate you have to turn right immediately on a faint looking track otherwise you‚Äôll be off walking around the hill wondering why you aren‚Äôt going up. It‚Äôs not very obvious at all, but after a little while the track starts to appear again. I‚Äôd been warned!\n\n\n\nViews to the south\n\n\nThe gradient steps up quite a bit and it‚Äôs a pretty relentless 300m climb. It starts to level out and you think you must be nearly there‚Ä¶but no you‚Äôre probably only about half way, but at least it‚Äôs nearly flat for a while. This process repeats and you think you‚Äôre nearly there again after climbing another steep section but no! Still a bit further to go.\n\n\n\nA false summit\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real summit\n\n\nIt was a glorious day at the top and I tried 2m FM first. I just have the slightly longer whip on the Boafeng, it‚Äôs okay but not the best. Others seem to have the slim G antenna from Spectrum communications, so I might need to get one of those. Only ¬£20. I had 3 on 2m, and then tried the repeater and got one of the same people again!\n\n\n\nNeed a longer arm\n\n\nI then setup HF, it was quite windy and the pole was getting blown about a lot but it was fine. I was trying out my newly made EFHW. It would only tune with a counterpoise but I think my feedpoint might be too close to the ground, however, it still works so that‚Äôs all that matters at the top!\n\n\n\nEFHW 49:1 transformer\n\n\n\n\n\nView of antenna looking south\n\n\nManaged 11 contacts on 20m, including a summit to summit in France. 40m seemed completely dead with just a local contact being the only one.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nA couple of folks started up the hill a bit after me, I was probably at the gate when they left the car park but I think the steepness slowed them down considerable as I was on my way back down before I met them.\nBack down was easier although you had to be careful with loose stones on the path when it was quite steep. Driving home I did a big sneeze in the car and felt something strange in my abdomen, this later turned out to be an inguinal hernia. Eugh.\n\n\n\nSummit selfie"

There‚Äôs not really much space to park, and I think the house is still occupied so you can‚Äôt block the road, but maybe two cars could park there.\n\n\n\nPark at the red dot and follow the path\n\n\nThe route up is fairly easy going, you walk east in front and around the summit before turning back on yourself and climbing up to the top. There‚Äôs a trig point where the summit marker is but then down the hill a little, along that path, is the cairn.\n\n\n\nImagine Peace\n\n\nI started with 2m at the trig point and managed 3, and then another 3 on 70cm. Meanwhile Chris, MM7RVP, was up Cairn-mon-earn and calling CQ on 2m as well. The four of us could hear him but he seemed to struggle to recieve. Like I did, there‚Äôs quite a bit of QRM from the communications towers there and I think his handheld was getting overloaded.\n\n\n\nSlim G by the cairn\n\n\nI setup the Slim G to see if that would help get through the Chris, but no luck again. So I took it down and setup HF. I did manage to get Chris on both 40m and 20m, for our summit to summit. I then called on 20m and ended up with another 11 EU contacts, including a summit to summit in Switzerland.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nI was pleased to manage two summits in one day. I had to be back for school pickup so timing wise it worked out quite well. There was a 1:20 gap between my last contact on Hill of Fare and my first on Benaquhallie, so these pair are a good combo, espeically if you can activate on VHF/UHF!\nMike, 2M0WMA, also taught us all, over the air, how to pronounce Benaquhallie. It‚Äôs something like ‚Äúben-a-whallie‚Äù, but with some good accent on the Wh. I think I was the only whallie that day.\n\n\n\nSSummit selfie"

    "text": "Ski Centre\nI‚Äôve had my eye on this summit for a while. It‚Äôs 8 points for starters, and I‚Äôve been doing a lot of 1 pointers recently, but it‚Äôs quite the drive to get to, so whilst it doesn‚Äôt take long to climb, the total round trip is considerable. It‚Äôs also (just) over 1,000m high but the car park is at 670m, so the actual ascent is only 420m - very similar to some lower summits. Morven, a 4 point summit, was a 650m ascent!\nThe weather was sunny in Aberdeen when I left, and the forecast threaten rain later in the afternoon. I did my calculations and figured I‚Äôd be back in the car before the rain came. It‚Äôs only a 45-60 minute ascent.\nYou start in the upper car park at Glenshee ski centre, you can park right by the start of the track. The car park is ¬£4 which you pay for via a website, except in the valley there‚Äôs no 4G+, so you need to wait until you‚Äôre up the first slope and get signal again before you can pay. The alternative is stop in at the cafe and pay, but I‚Äôd already parked and wanted to get going.\nThe route is fairly straight forward in summer. The path is obvious, although it had a lot of loose gravel in many places. There are a few ups and downs along the way but nothing too bad. The steepest part is beyond the ski lift buildings on the final rise up to the main plateau. The path looks obvious from a distance but when you‚Äôre on it, it blends in with the terrain. Again, lots of loose stones here but a steady pace and I was at the top.\nIt‚Äôs still another 600m or so until you get to the actual summit, and I could see it being very easy to get lost in low cloud at this point, especially on the way back, it‚Äôs wide and featureless. Luckily the cloud wasn‚Äôt low, it was overcast but the view was still amazing, and on a clear day it must be spectacular.\nI met another walker sitting in the cairn having his lunch. We spoke for a bit and then I looked for somewhere else to setup. A bit further away there were two smaller piles of rocks I thought I could shelter behind. The wind was persistent and I needed my hood to keep my ears warm.\nI‚Äôve taken to just activating summits with VHF if I can, not that I don‚Äôt like doing HF, I just enjoy the simplicity of using a handheld and speaking to the locals. This is particularly the case if I don‚Äôt want to be sitting around for a long time, and whilst the rain‚Äôs arrival was forecast to be later still, I didn‚Äôt really want to hang around more than necessary. I setup the slim G on the carbon-6 pole and started calling CQ.\nI‚Äôd forgotten to spot, but I started on 145.500 MHz, the 2m calling frequency, and I‚Äôm used to 2m spotting not really helping. Stations started coming back to me from considerable distances, at least what I‚Äôm used to. Something I‚Äôm not used to is everyone asking to QSY to another frequency. The first caller who asked I sort of ignored his first request as I didn‚Äôt think it was necessary, but I did then move and we had a nice chat. I guess when there‚Äôs actually some activity or a big area it makes sense to move. I‚Äôve just used to the 4-6 people on 2m when I‚Äôm on the lower summits nearer Aberdeen that it doesn‚Äôt matter if we talk for 15 minutes on the calling frequency as there‚Äôs no-one else!\nMy furthest was 92 miles right across the west coast to GM4OAS. I was only a 31 for him but we managed. Had GM0USI/M driving on the A90 between Perth and Dundee, and then a guy walking his dog somewhere in East Lothian carrying his boafeng with him. He just had a rubber duck on, but his signal was strong with me, his audio was a bit muffled at times though. He gave his call as M7SGX, and so I was confused where he was, thinking he was in England. However, he‚Äôd just chosen to omit the RSL. Unless I misheard him several times!1\nI didn‚Äôt get anyone back in Aberdeen but I had 8 which was plenty. I did spot myself and called some more but that was it. I heard someone else but I think it was a repeater and my VFO B happened to be on its frequency but I didn‚Äôt have it programmed in (assume it was the Dundee one). As it happens I don‚Äôt think any of the repeaters in my D72 are correct, and I should add the others around Scotland.\nThe excitement of such far reaching FM contacts had kept me distracted from other walkers who were around and the cold wind. I looked up to see a few other people walking around, but no-one came to talk to me. I finished my lunch, debated about HF for a moment, but then decided I‚Äôd rather be getting home and packed up.\nThe walk down was trickier due to the scree patches and at one point I started marching off in the wrong direction as the path split. I could see the car park so I quickly realised the path wasn‚Äôt taking me down to it.\nNext time I think a yagi and a radio with 2m SSB!"

    "text": "Another hill, this time to the south of Aberdeen. The weather was wet and windy in the morning, particularly so inland, so thought I‚Äôd stick to the coast. The two options were Strathfinella or Hill of Garvock. Reports of angry cows from Garvock, plus the sheltered nature of the wooded summit of Strathfinella made the decision for me.\nConsulting Fraser, MM0EFI, the local SOTA expert, I was going to climb it from the south, following forestry roads and mountain bike paths. Looked to be fairly short route and a quick claim to the top. It‚Äôs only a one pointer, so never going to be that far.\n\n\n\nRoute from the south\n\n\nThe weather was pretty good, breezy but some sun and mild. The route was straightforward- literally. There were a few bikers around who I met just before the turn off to the summit.\n\n\n\nLeft or right? Nope. Straight on.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a chat with some of the mountain bikers but just said I was out for a walk. Too much effort to get into the real reason! They pointed me towards the trig point which was off to the side of the main path. I almost missed it whilst walking along! It‚Äôs right in the trees, and reminded me of the portal stones from the Realm of the Enderlings book series!\nI set up 2m first and got a guy down in Brechin, unfortunately he was the only 2m QSO. I spent a long time calling and then decided to move to HF.\nThe summit is a bit of a black spot for mobile reception and I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that. I use my phone for 2m spotting and for SOTA spotting or looking up other activators. I‚Äôve signed up and registered for APRS to SOTA, and SOTAMAT, a FT8 spotter, and maybe even a SMS one, but do I know how to use them?! üòÖ\nI eventually managed to spot myself on 40m and got a few contacts. 20m spot did work but no one ever came back to me‚Ä¶even though I‚Äôd had a few contacts with other callers.\n\n\n\nQSOs\n\n\nI managed two S2S contacts in Germany. One was an exchange of 11-31 each way but we managed to get my callsign and SOTA reference communicated.\nOn the way down I thought about doing Hill of Garvock but I hadn‚Äôt packed lunch and still had to get back home. Maybe a double activation next time!"

    "text": "Another nice day and another chance for some activiations. After my trip to Strathfinella and not doing Garvock on the same day, I was determined to try for two in one day today. So I was more prepared with lunch and routes this time.\nFirst was Hill of Fare. There‚Äôs a car park called Back of Hill of Fare on the B993 where there‚Äôs space for 5-10 cars by the side of a log store. I then followed the path up from there. A couple of new looking fences have been installed but there are some nice gates. They had very high handles, which I thought was strange, but then someone pointed out they‚Äôre for horse riders.\n\n\n\nGood views on the way up\n\n\nProbably took around 50-60 minutes to reach the top. It‚Äôs quite a wide opening at the top, with some small pools of water.\nI didn‚Äôt want to hang about long, so 2M FM got me 3 contacts and then I switched to 70cm to activate the summit. Three people, 4 callsigns and 2 bands in about 10 minutes! Time to go to the next one, and hopefully arrive in time to catch Chris, MM7RVP, going up Cairn-mon-earn for a summit to summit contact.\n\n\n\nSlim G on the pole"

    "text": "It‚Äôs been a few weeks since my last activation and I wanted to go out. I didn‚Äôt have much time as I was meant to be sorting out the garage, so I picked a summit close to home, Cairn-Mon-Earn (GM/ES-080).\n\n\n\nSSE working on one of the towers\n\n\nIt‚Äôs quite an easy walk following the loggers roads up to the summit. There are multiple towers there for mobile phones and other networks. The local repeater, GB3GN, is also here. The weather was dry, and I had the occasional blue sky, but showers were forecasted.\nIt was windy too, so I hunkered down by the cairn, however, this probably wasn‚Äôt the best place being so close to the towers. I setup my slim G 2m on the mast and called CQ. I didn‚Äôt get any response so setup on HF. The ground slopes away with heather and bushes, so I decided just to go for the random wire vertical. It has a 5.5m radiator and 2 counterpoises. I started on 20m, and two stations replied, Spain and Finland. This turned out to be my lot on HF. I tried other bands and calling other stations but no one could hear me. It was a shame as there were several other summits I could hear.\n\n\n\nSlim G on the carbon 6 mast\n\n\nI managed to get MM0EFI on the HT, and so I was at 3 contacts. A SOTA summit needs 4 to activate. It had been about an hour and the rain started to come down heavily. I dashed across to some nearby trees and setup underneath one of them. After trying all the bands I came back to 20m, put out another spot and the same Spanish station came back to me‚Ä¶well at least I knew it wasn‚Äôt operator error with the radio or antenna!\n\n\n\nUnder the tree\n\n\n\n\n\nWet!\n\n\nThis was meant to be a quick activation and I‚Äôd now been there for over and hour, and so decided to pack up HF. I could see the TV mast in the clouds and so walked over to get a better look. I then found what would be a great spot to activate (if it wasn‚Äôt raining) as it had clear views all around. I thought I might as well call on 2m and see if I could get anyone.\nI spoke to Fraser again, MM0EFI, now /M as he was driving to work. We made a contact with his intermediate callsign, 2M0EFI/M, so technically I‚Äôd activated the site. However, I was determined to get four different people, and in my next CQ, George, MM0SAX/M, replied.\n\n\n\nView across the to TV mast\n\n\nGeorge was driving up from Glasgow on the A90 and has a radio in his work van. We had a nice chat for about 15 minutes, and that turned my ‚Äúthis has been a waste of time ü§¨‚Äù attitude into a ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt so bad üôÇ‚Äù one!\nI enjoy HF and setting up different antenna, but if I could reliably activate with just 2m/70cm I‚Äôd love to go up the hillside with just my HT.\n\n\n\nBefore I knew what the activation would entail\n\n\nIt was back down and back home. The kids were soon home from school and the garage didn‚Äôt get sorted out. I‚Äôll try again next week‚Ä¶"

    "text": "A lovely sunny day, and time for another activation. Hopefully better than the last ‚Äì certainly the weather was better. üåû\nQuite a close summit to home, Brimmond Hill overlooks Aberdeen and the airport to the east and then Aberdeenshire to the west. There‚Äôs a walk up and over it which is popular with dog walkers, and so I met more people than I usually do on this summit. The hill also features several commercial towers which make a bit of noise on 2m. Usually a pip every so often and then a huge blast of rf that completely wipes anything out, interestingly around the 2m and 70cm calling frequencies but not so bad away from them.\n\n\n\nLooking towards the sea\n\n\n\n\n\nMast up and ready\n\n\n\n\n\nNoise machine\n\n\nI tried 2m first, with the Slim G on the pole and made a couple of contacts locally. There‚Äôs a bench that looks out over Aberdeen that I was going to setup on, but the aforementioned dog walkers came by and sat on the bench, so I decided to move off and find a spot in the heather. MM7RVC recorded me calling at his house somewhere to the west, showing off his pole and slim G ‚Äì so we got a SG2SG QSO.\nVideo\nFor HF I went with the EFHW for 40m, with the 49:1 (keep meaning to write up making that but not got round to it yet! Nothing special mind), setup on the 6m carbon pole. Generally running north-south. The weather was lovely, there was a breeze but it wasn‚Äôt too cold, and so for most of the time I tried chasing other summit activators. This worked well, as I ended up with five summit-to-summit (S2S) QSOs across England, German, Austria and Poland. I then put out spots for myself and got a few more contacts.\nI think the battery was low in the radio as it was only outputting 5W, not that 10W would‚Äôve made a huge difference, but I still find it impressive what 5W can do.\n\n\n\nQSO Map\n\n\nIt was time to pack up, and I thought I‚Äôd see if I could catch anyone else on VHF/UHF. There‚Äôs a local lunchtime net, although I can never remember if its 12:30, 1 or 1:30pm that it starts. I got my Slim G back out and on the mast and this time I did sit on the bench. The net was going on and after a long over I managed to break in and say hello. We also did a quick QSO on 70cm. I‚Äôm not sure if the Slim G is suitable for 70cm. It worked but at what SWR? I should measure it and see. Another couple with their dog came up and wanted to come to the view point but one look of me and they decided to keep going! üòÖ At this point my HT ran out of battery too!\n\n\n\nSlim G in the wind\n\n\n\n\n\nAction shot!\n\n\nIf I was YouTubing myself, everyone would think it normal! I ended up overtaking the couple walking back to the car. I said ‚ÄúHi‚Äù but no QSL on that contact."

You then request a username and password via their Telegram bot. I‚Äôm not detailing much as their instructions are plain and the process is super easy. You do have to use Telegram but it‚Äôs okay.\nThey have a list of supported hardware, and whilst the V3 isn‚Äôt mentioned, people on Telegram says it works.

However, it only showed the 433 MHz version.\nTelegram is fine and that, but like Discord, it‚Äôs not the easiest to find useful information. Compared to Discourses forum or Github issues etc., however, it does cost the project team nothing so I don‚Äôt begrudge them that. You can search posts but it takes a lot of effort to work through them and likely multiple conversations happening at the same time. Hence this post‚Ä¶\nYou can change the frequency by logging into the webadmin, which, strangely, is actually the public website and not the dashboard that runs locally on your device. You have to request a link from the TinyGS telegram bot with /weblogin and it produces a tinygs.com url for you. As it‚Äôs Telegram I‚Äôm using my phone for it, no doubt there‚Äôs a computer client too.\nYou then click on your station, and a new menu appears.\nThe top dropdown lets you change it to 868 (or 900+ depending on your region) MHz, and voila!"

    "text": "I think I first heard about QO-100 when looking at a local amateur‚Äôs QRZ page. He‚Äôd setup a couple of satellite dishes in his garden and had his QO-100 DX Club logo on his profile page, along with some other links. That started me down the rabbit hole. üêáüõ∞Ô∏è\nBriefly, and there‚Äôs more details here, QO-100 is the name given to a geostationary satellite that sits above Africa and has amateur radio transponders. This means it‚Äôs always in the same place, and can be used by amateur radio license holders to make contacts across its coverage. Being in such a high orbit means it has a huge area of coverage, so you can contact anyone in this area and talk to them for hours without the worry of propagation changing and losing contact.\nAnother thing that makes this interesting is that it has both narrow and wide bands. This allows for voice, Morse and simpler digital modes on the narrowband and then on the wide band amateur television! So people can broadcast video via the satellite, there‚Äôs even a weekly net by the British Amateur Television Club (BATC), and they sometimes save them to YouTube. Doing video broadcasting requires a lot more equipment and power, and is maybe a step too far for me.\nThe satellite has been in orbit for about 5 years, so there are a lot of tutorials and guides online on how to get setup, together with people making items that help get connected. The main ones I found useful where DK1MI‚Äôs, M0AWS‚Äôs, and G7IYK‚Äôs Instructables page. My setup is basically the same as DK1MI and G7IYK‚Äôs, which I‚Äôll explain shortly.\nThere seems to be two approaches to getting on the air with QO-100, one is via a SDR that can transmit as well as receive and the other is a transverter that takes you transmitter‚Äôs 2m or 70cm output and ups it to the send frequency. This means you can use a real radio to transmit. You can then either use a SDR for receive or use a downconverter and have your radio be the Rx as well. As I don‚Äôt have a 2m/70cm radio, and the location of my dish is not conducive to using a radio, I went with the SDR option, as that means everything can be housed in a box underneath the dish and all I have to run to it is power and ethernet.\nLike most satellites the uplink and the downlink are on different frequencies, in this case it‚Äôs an uplink of 2.4 GHz (think wifi) and downlink is 10 GHz. The downlink is fairly easy, as a LNB (think Sky dish) can receive it and converts it down to 700 MHz range. This is perfectly fine for most SDR receivers to use. Uplink generally requires some amplification as either the upconverter or the SDR only outputs at very low power‚Ä¶but now we‚Äôre getting too into the detail."

    "section": "My Plans",
    "text": "My Plans\nMy in a loose sense of the word as it‚Äôs pretty much copying what many others have already done and figured out. I just found it useful to layout so that I could make sure I had all the right parts, particularly on the power side. I also attempted to figure out the power on the transmit side. Original version here.\n\n\n\nMy QO-100 Schematic\n\n\n\nThe Receive\nYou‚Äôll want a dish. I mooned over a 1.2m dish for a long time, but the price and size meant it was a no go for me. 80 cm seemed a common size for narrowband, and wideband probably wants something bigger than 1.2 anyway. I measured up where I was planning on putting it and 1.2m was probably too big, maybe I could of squeezed in a 1m but 80 cm should be good enough.\nWhen thinking about what dish size, it‚Äôs important to think about the location of it. The satellite is to the south from the UK, near enough the same direction as sky dishes ‚Äì a good guide if you or neighbours have on. You can get dish pointing info from the BATC on their website. So you can drag a pin around to place it exactly where you want it.\nI originally wanted it on a south westerly wall but it probably would‚Äôve ended up being mounted at 90¬∞ and that would mean being at least 40cm off the wall ‚Äì perfect for a gust of wind to rip it off! However, I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a south-ish facing wall at the back of my house and so it was okay to find another location. I also bought a U shaped mount, so it could sit flush to the wall, which helps with wind loading and keeping it out the way.\nThe signal is focused onto a LNB (low-noise block downconverter). According to the internet, the Bullseye LNB is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù one. It‚Äôs fairly cheap, ~¬£30, and stable. In order for it to recieve the signal, a voltage has to be applied for polarisation of the signal. In our case, for the narrowband we need it to be vertically polarised and so applying 12V is what‚Äôs needed. This is done with a handy biased tee, that allows you to inject the voltage to the feed from the LNB, but blocks the DC voltage from continuing on to your recevier. I used satellite cable, the typical f type connector, 75 ohm stuff.\nThat‚Äôs it! The signal then continues to your SDR, in my case the Pluto+ SDR. A cheap SDR like a RTL-SDR or NooElec will do the job. As I said, a(nother) downconverter is an option but not the route I took.\n\n\nPluto+ SDR\nNow‚Äôs a good time to talk about this SDR. First came the Adalm-Pluto by Analog devices. A great SDR which has transmit and recieve and ideal for students and amateurs alike. Many people use this SDR with great success and many have modified it themselves to improve it.\nThe Pluto+ is an upgraded version of Analog device‚Äôs SDR with various improvements available out of the box. Most noticeable are the metal enclosure, the four SMA connections, for two sets of recevie and transmit, a gigabit ethernet connection, a microSD slot, a external clock input on the PCB, and 0.5 ppm TCXO. Probably there are other tweaks too but not things that stood out to me. To me the biggest selling point was the network port and the relative ease at which you can add a GPSDO for stability (not something I had as part of the original plan but a nice blog post from DK1MI again shows how easy it is to add).\nIn my hours of searching and reading forums I recall coming across something like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre building on from scratch go for the Pluto+‚Äù, and so I did. I bought mine from Aliexpress.\nTech Minds has a nice video on it if you want to see more.\n\n\nThe Transmit\nThe Pluto+ SDR has a transmit and can output 2.4 GHz in the region of up to 4 mW, which is great but also not going to get you a contact, and so some amplification is needed. These days it‚Äôs pretty much a standard design to use the Analog Devices CN-0417 amplifier straight out of the SDR and then another one to take it to up to 20 W. It seems like you really only need 10 W with a 80 cm dish to get a strong signal. In fact, if you transmit with too much power you hear a two-tone siren going off called LEILA warning you to turn down. A popular amp is the SG Labs 20W model from Bulgaria, and so that‚Äôs what I picked. 20W seems useful to overcome and losses in connectors and cables.\nWhich brings to me to cables. At 2.4 GHz, losses are high on regular coax (RG58/213) and so you really want some fancier stuff. I went for LMR-400-UF (UF for ultra-flexible to get round corners). It has many layers and is quite something to hold after only ever using RG58 on HF. You also want to keep it as short as possible and so the amplifier needs to be near your dish.\nFinally, the actual feed to the dish. There seems to be two or three styles people use, a ‚ÄúPOTY‚Äù or a helix seem most common. I felt like there were a lot of pieces to this build and so I wasn‚Äôt wanting to build everything myself, I decided to buy an Ice Cone feed from nolle engineering in Germany. This is a helix design, housed in a 3D printed case that looks like a huge ice cream cone. It‚Äôs designed very well and sits on top of the LNB (they even sell adapters for the most common LNBs people use with QO-100).\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a three scoop minimum.\n\n\n\n\nPower\nAll these bits and bobs need power, and at different voltages:\n\nThe biased tee needs 12 V\nThe Pluto+ SDR and CN-0417 need 5 V\nSG Labs PA needs 24-28 V\n\nAgain, as a common build, people have found a common solution, particularly as a lot of people power it from their shack power supply, and everything hangs off a 12 V supply. There are two DC converters, one to 5V with USB sockets for those users and then one that converts to 28V (although is adjustable) from 12V.\nFor me, and the location of my shack and the dish meant I needed an external power supply. Luckily, I have an external power socket within 5m or so of the dish so I just needed to convert it to 12V. In the end I decided upon a Meanwell power brick ‚Äì think laptop brick ‚Äì which gives up to 5A on 12V, this should be more than enough. I also bought a great long kettle lead to plug it in. Going for the brick meant it could sit in my waterproof enclosure with everything else. Plus the 5V DC converter had a pin socket, so I could use the pin from the power supply to power it and then the input pins, which are in parallel, for transferring that 12V on to the other users.\nFor the enclosure I found this on screwfix. It‚Äôs just about big enough. The mounting isn‚Äôt great but works.\n\n\nCost\nIt‚Äôs quite pricey to do this build. Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to list it all here and add it up üòÖ However, as I didn‚Äôt have a 70cm/2m radio this route was probably going to be the cheapest. I could‚Äôve scounged more on items, or tried to find more things used, but insted I bought the parts over about 6 weeks, then when it was only one ¬£100-150 thing a week it didn‚Äôt feel that bad! Ballpark is probably ¬£600-700. I also ended up buying some tools and general items that I didn‚Äôt have, but will be useful for other projects.\n\n\nand finally‚Ä¶\nHave I built it yet? I have, (and maybe why I struggle with tense in this post!) it still has a couple of issues but I‚Äôve made some QSOs. More details in the next part.\n\n\n\nInpromptu dish mounting"

Steve, M0XVT, raised that he joins a 60m net and we all thought that sounded like a good idea to try. We‚Äôd agreed to join at 9pm on 5.3985 MHz. This would be my first attempts on the 60 m / 5 MHz band.\nMy HF antenna is a EFHW for 40m, and it‚Äôs not naturally resonant on 60m, but I suspected my Xiegu G90 would be able to tune it up as it‚Äôs pretty decent at matching anything to anything!\n\n\n\nBand plan summary from RSGB\n\n\nMy only experience with the 5 MHz band is from my full licence exam. The UK band plan is probably the most complex band plan there is for amateur radio. It makes it ideal for writing exam questions! The amount of warnings about transmitting outside the band plan due to the other user of the frequecy, aka the military, does make for careful planning. The RSGB page has lots of info on it, but it‚Äôs not the sort of thing you just quickly tune to and call CQ or even respond to others.\nThe 60m net, 5.3985 MHz, is on Sunday mornings at 0700 UTC, but I‚Äôve not joined in as I‚Äôm still between shacks.\nI also learnt of the trick of using a WebSDR to listen to a net you‚Äôre in. Sometimes they can hear you but not vice-versa, and so at least this helps with the flow of the net. You can get some software to sync your SDR and rig (or write your own with NodeRed) but for a net, when you‚Äôre not moving about, manually setting is good enough."

    "text": "Shortly after getting on the air with my Xiegu G90, I became intrigued by FT8. After some initial experimentation, I managed to set it up and began making QSOs. Initially, I was thrilled to hear stations from all over the world ‚Äì Australia, Japan, South America, and various other places. At first, I believed I could establish contact with all of them. However, after numerous attempts to connect with different stations, I discovered pskreporter. This tool allowed me to determine who could hear me. While it was disappointing to realize that hearing a station didn‚Äôt guarantee they could hear me, seeing the immediate feedback on pskreporter was just as enjoyable as making an actual contact, especially on days when distant countries could receive my signals.\nThe information provided by pskreporter makes FT8 interesting, especially when testing new antennas or different power levels. However, excessive usage of it can become somewhat monotonous. It‚Äôs convenient when used alongside other activities, but sitting in front of it for prolonged periods without any other engagement is not advisable. Depending on your antenna setup, you may find that you‚Äôre only able to reach specific parts of the world, making it nearly impossible to make new connections. While I occasionally manage to contact a few new countries with my horizontal EFHW antenna, it‚Äôs not as effective as a vertical, such as this one described by M0AWS.\nI found the user interface of WSJT-X somewhat lacking and soon discovered GridTracker. As it says on the website ‚ÄúGridTracker listens to traffic from WSJT-X and displays it on a map‚Äú. While it offers more functionality, that‚Äôs the core idea. I use its call roster to identify who‚Äôs calling or communicating, making my contacts based on that information. Only recently did I delve into the manual on the website and decide to pursue grid square chasing.\nA conversation in the Ham radio matrix chat about gamifying FT8 caught my attention. This intrigued me, as it seemed like a way to inject more interest into FT8. The most apparent approach was to start collecting grid squares from different countries. Now, I had a reason to contact those Italian and German stations. GridTracker proved to be highly useful for this purpose."

    "text": "Useful GridTracker Settings\nI encourage you to read the full manual, it‚Äôs not that long and you‚Äôll then understand the whole software much better. Here are the settings I‚Äôve discovered that simplify the process of collecting grid squares using the software.\n\nCall Roster\n\n\n\nTable of contacts\n\n\nI hardly ever use the map view in GridTracker. While it does display pskreport spots along with grids, the map can become cluttered, making it challenging to discern the information. I might briefly glance at the spot heatmap or switch to pskreporter for my spotters. My primary focus is on the call roster. This window is positioned next to WSJT-X‚Äôs main window and waterfall display. The call roster streamlines the substantial amount of information from WSJT-X into a concise, organized format. It allows for various filters, but I generally keep the filters quite open, toggling between all activity and CQ calls only.\nThe standout feature is the color coding of cells. A black background signifies a confirmed contact, a black-blue gradient indicates an unconfirmed contact, and a blue background represents a new grid. This arrangement allows me to quickly identify areas I still need to reach. With the CQ Only filter activated, it becomes easy to determine whom to respond to. Another setting I find useful is marking RR73 as a CQ. This way, I can spot stations just finishing up their last QSO, and I might have a chance to catch them as they start calling CQ.\nTo open the call roster, click on the Clipboard/Medal button in the menu. üìãü•á\n\n\nMap View\nAlthough I seldom use the map view, it serves as a useful tool to track your progress with grids. The heatmap of spots can also provide valuable insights. Ensure that you have the bands set to ‚ÄúMixed‚Äù rather than the default ‚ÄúAuto.‚Äù The Auto setting uses the band you‚Äôre currently on, which limts what you see, and unless your trying to get all the grids by band you probably want Mixed. Mixed displays all bands.\n\n\n\nMixed shows all bands\n\n\n\n\nLog data\nGrid Tracker is only useful if it knows all your logs. By default it‚Äôll read the wsjt-x log file on your computer but that won‚Äôt always have everything, and if you want to include voice or other modes that won‚Äôt help. The way I‚Äôve found to work best is to use its ability to import log data from elsewhere. There are a few options and you can set them in the Logging page of the settings.\n\n\n\nAll the logs\n\n\nGrid Tracker can pull and push log data. The Startup? and Menu? settings show the options for pulling log data, with startup meaning it queries it when you open Grid Tracker, and Menu meaning it adds a button to the menu for you to trigger a download. As you can see above the options are local files, psk-reporter, qrz, clublog and LoTW. I decided to go with LoTW as that seems to be the most commonly used central logging database. This means that wherever I capture my QSOs, as long as they get into LoTW, Grid Tracker will know about them. I could just add all of the others too.\nFor longer operating sessions with numerous QSOs, clicking the LoTW button in the menu will pull in confirmations. GridTracker maintains its own log, providing a record of your contacts.\nI also use GridTracker to send my WSJT-X logs to Cloudlog, my primary logbook. This process subsequently uploads all my logs to platforms like LoTW, Clublog, and eQSL. As indicated in the Log? column, GridTracker interfaces with various popular logging tools.\nIn essence, GridTracker‚Äôs configuration is straightforward and quick, enhancing the appeal of WSJT-X data and simplifying the tracking of contacts."

    "text": "Appreciating FT8\nWhile I‚Äôve been licensed for a relatively short time, I‚Äôve encountered strong opinions about FT8, including some negative viewpoints. I don‚Äôt enjoy coffee, but I wouldn‚Äôt tell coffee enthusiasts that they‚Äôre consuming it incorrectly. I won‚Äôt speculate on the reasons people dislike FT8, but instead, I‚Äôll share some observations that might not be immediately apparent.\nThese days, it‚Äôs common for unique locations to incorporate FT8 into their setups. Therefore, if you‚Äôre aiming to access new DX locations, FT8 offers a viable method. I also appreciate that it levels the playing field to some extent, unlike SSB or even CW. How often have I heard a VK or JA station (not rare DX, just less common), only to be faced with an overwhelming pileup as European countries with 2 kW power outputs drown out smaller stations like mine, operating at 100 W? Breaking through is nearly impossible. While CW might provide slightly better odds due to fewer operators compared to SSB, plus the reduced SNR needed to work someone, the challenge for QRP stations remains. With FT8, if your signal reaches them with 10W or 50W, your presence is acknowledged, significantly improving your chances. While there may be techniques for gaining an edge when working a pileup station on FT8, such as adjusting transmit settings or clock settings, the gap is much smaller. Skill is required here as well.\nWhen engaging with a popular station on SSB or CW, conversations are often minimal. Regular HF QSOs frequently consist of a brief exchange involving callsigns, RST, and possibly a name or location. This is not drastically different from an FT8 QSO. If your goal is to accumulate numerous contacts, reach various locations, or connect with rare stations, FT8 offers similar dynamics. If you seek in-depth discussions, FT8 isn‚Äôt the appropriate choice; it‚Äôs not a direct comparison. For that purpose, you might explore JS8Call.\nIn closing, while I risk getting sidetracked into an argument, I emphasize that the beauty of amateur radio as a hobby is rooted in personal enjoyment. If you find it enjoyable, that‚Äôs fantastic! If not, then there‚Äôs no obligation to pursue it; everyone‚Äôs preferences differ.\n\n\n\nGotta catch em all! üê≤üî¥üéÆüìª\n\n\nNow, back to the quilt!

However, it‚Äôs not entirely obvious how to do this. In fact, when I spoke to ofcom about reserving a call or putting a hold on it, the guy said ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry about it, hardly anyone knows how to apply for a G callsign anyway‚Äù. üòÖ\nYou can get all the G# except G2, and they also no longer give out 2 letter callsigns, e.g.¬†G3DX1. You can only get a two letter callsign one is given to you. This is typically if a relative of the original holder (who is now sk) writes a letter or does something that convinces ofcom to give it to you. The original holder doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be a relative of yours, but perhaps the story has to be somewhat more convincing.\nThe process is fairly simple, but it will cost you a one off fee of ¬£20 (compared to free if you get a M0). You fill in the form, email ofcom, wait for a reply in which an invoice is added to your ofcom account (that you‚Äôll have as you‚Äôd have needed it for foundation and intermediate‚Ä¶.unless you never bothered getting those or you did the direct to full exam). You pay the invoice online and your licence is generated immediately! This method can also be used if you want a club callsign that doesn‚Äôt start M0.\nThe form is pretty self-explanatory, but an important thing to note is that you only get to enter three choices of callsign, with the order of preference stated. If those ones aren‚Äôt available, then they‚Äôll assign you a M0 callsign randomly. They don‚Äôt contact you to say those three aren‚Äôt available and would you like to try again. So I‚Äôd recommend calling them (020 7981 3131) before you send in your form to check the availability. Surprisingly, there‚Äôs virtually no wait and they‚Äôre happy to check a few calls, I tried three but sensed more than five and they might get annoyed ‚Äì depends on who you get. You could of course call back another day and try some more.\nThe online application for M0 is great as it immediately tells you if the callsign is available or not, whereas the form you have to call to check. Now there are ways you can check yourself to try and screen things out."

Searching for this is a quick way to find it, or using the whatdotheyknow website and a search, such as this one against ofcom. This will show you what‚Äôs been taken, and then you can see if someone already has the call you want or not. Plus you can use Excel filtering and formula to check or test calls you are thinking of. Personally, I found these lists to be full of errors, so I‚Äôd recommend a second way to filter down your list of potential calls.\nThis would be via qrz.com. I think the majority of UK amateur radio operators make an account on QRZ. Even if they have absolutely nothing in their profile they probably have one. If you‚Äôre registered, then you can use the wildcard search and then look for profiles to see if someone has the call already. You can use a question mark (?) to match a single wildcard character or star (*) to match multiple characters. The thing to remember is the regional locator in the UK, so whilst G5ALX might look available, I actually have that callsign but my profile is under GM5ALX. Also, ofcom make available sk callsigns after two years‚Ä¶assuming they know the person is silent.\nOf course, phoning them up and asking is the final test, but it‚Äôs best if you‚Äôve got a shortlist prepared already. Assuming they say it‚Äôs available, then away goes your form and welcome to the full licence!\nFuture upgrades to the online system were part of the recent consultation, and so in time this process won‚Äôt be necessary and you can select all the prefixes and see immediately if it‚Äôs available or not. The consultation also suggested they would let people change their callsigns every so often, so maybe you‚Äôll get another shot at it and you whole amateur radio career won‚Äôt all be resting on this decision!"

    "text": "How to pick a callsign?\nThis is all well and good, but how do you choose a callsign in the first place! In some ways the old style of ‚Äúyou get what you‚Äôre given‚Äù takes the pain out of it but it‚Äôs nice having a choice. It‚Äôs a personal preference, but there are a couple of things you might want to consider:\n\nHow does it sound phonetically?\nHow does it sound and what‚Äôs the weight via CW?\n\nSay it out loud a few time, and see if you like the ring of it. There might be some words you don‚Äôt like, or you might want to avoid as in your accent they sound like other words. I find people think I‚Äôm saying papa when I say alpha, which can get annoying, so I might say ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù instead. Mike and Golf are only one syllable, which might seem good but the point of phonetics is to help the listener understand and one syllable only gives them one chance vs.¬†two/three.\nCW wise, I think it‚Äôs worth thinking about even if you don‚Äôt do CW now. You can‚Äôt change you callsign again, and even if we do get the ability later, will you really want to? You get used to things, and sorting out logbooks and QSL cards or even friends you‚Äôve made, all rely on the same callsign. I think it‚Äôs worth considering, even if you still pick you call with a ‚Äúterrible‚Äù CW factor.\nI picked up that letter that end with dit ( . ) aren‚Äôt great as they might get missed, and particularly avoid your callsign ending in B or K or E. If you search about for advice, it seems like there aren‚Äôt any letters left that you should use! You can also calculate the weight of a call, such as on FISTs website, which is a measure of how long it takes to send. Given that we‚Äôre all G(RSL)# and three letters, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a huge variation but maybe it helps differentiate some calls for you.\nThink about when you‚Äôve been on the air and heard others‚Äô callsigns. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve come across some that you think sound good. If you can‚Äôt remember them now, then try and make a note in your log when you do, and see what it is about them you like. I think repetition of letters makes things easier to copy. I‚Äôve heard the DX call out ‚Äúthe delta delta call‚Äù, because it sticks out and instantly memorable.\nThis guy made some slides and a spreadsheet to help you decide. If you‚Äôre an analysis person then you might like it, but try not to spend too long!"

I don‚Äôt know why I was in a rush, he was on for hours, but always a chance he‚Äôd move on to 20m for EU/US stations. This meant I was still on 25 W from last time I used the radio for FT8 when I called him. Now, 25W to 100W is only 6 dB (notionally an S point), so in some respects not a big deal, but you never know and sometimes it can make a difference.\nHe heard me just fine, 56. I meant to tell him he was 59 but forgot with telling him my name and location ‚Äì he gets a bit frustrated when people don‚Äôt tell him their name üòÖ ‚Äì and thought I‚Äôd say it on the next over, but I didn‚Äôt get one. Not that it mattered at all.\n\n\n20 seconds of fame.

    "text": "I spent a while debating if I really wanted to build this. I knew the build would be fun, but would it be fun using it? I also knew it wasn‚Äôt cheap, and would I regret it once I was done? After a few weeks of thinking this whilst researching the build, I ended up ordering the helix ice cone antenna late one June night. There was no going back now.\nOver the course of a couple a weeks I ordered all the parts, buying a few each day made it feel like I wasn‚Äôt spending too much!\nThere were also a bunch of bits and pieces I ended up buying as I didn‚Äôt have them. Like drill bits for making holes, screws, zip ties, small files, wire, etc. which I needed for this project but will be useful for other things. So accounting for some sundries, the total cost is about ¬£800.\nTo cut some costs, you could definitely get a cheaper dish and mount, there are plenty on eBay for less or you might be lucky and find something lying around. You might want to try an old sky dish too. The helix antenna is maybe another area to cut costs, either by building it yourself (if you have a 3D printer) or maybe getting a POTY. I didn‚Äôt look into the POTY, don‚Äôt have a 3D printer and mostly wanted something that I knew would just work. I could‚Äôve tried cheaper cable for 2.4 GHz as well.\nIf you already have a VHF/UHF radio, then an upconverter, like the one from DX Patrol, will save you some money vs.¬†going with the Pluto+SDR, although you will probably need to get an SDR receiver as well. The DX Patrol power amplifier is more expensive, but gives you pins for SWR etc. wheres the SG Labs doesn‚Äôt.\nSG Labs ordering process is a reassuring one üòÖ. You email them, they let you know the price, you send them money on paypal and then you wait a few weeks for the shipping confirmation. Lead time was about 3 weeks for me."

There‚Äôs almost no soldering and it‚Äôs just joining things together once you‚Äôve figured out the layout in the box and how you‚Äôre getting power and network to it. Depending on you situation this will be a breeze or a massive pain in the neck! I think my situation was somewhere in betewen, not easy but not impossible. Here are some photos of my build underway.\n\n\n\nUnpacking the dish\n\n\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a big ice cream\n\n\n\n\n\n1st receive testing\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the voltage\n\n\n\n\n\nFancy connectors\n\n\n\n\n\nOops!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team of expert dish aligners\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking alignment\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting the helix\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking some more holes\n\n\n\n\n\nBox of tricks\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting transmit\n\n\n\n\n\nWeatherproofing\n\n\nThe hardest parts for me was making up the fancy fittings on the LMR400 coax. There was a N type and a SMA fitting and they both had several parts and soldering of the pin. I fell foul to the usual thing of forgetting a bit and cutting off slightly too much. I also didn‚Äôt have a pair of wire cutters that could get through the coax ‚Äì it‚Äôs so thick! However, after making the ends up, I really like the cable, and going back to RG58 is like using thread after holding some rope!\nMy dish is located on a fake balcony, so it‚Äôs out the way but also not very accessible. I have to get the ladders out each time or climb out a bedroom window, this usually put me off doing much on an evening as I couldn‚Äôt be bothered with the ladders, and one of kids was sleeping in said bedroom! Overall I was very slow at putting it all together, but if you could dedicate a day to it, then you‚Äôd finish it in one go.\nAt my QTH, the dish elevation has to be at 20.5 degrees. I found this to be the absolute lower limit for my dish, whereby the scale starts at 20 degrees, and I think for an 80 cm dish it only goes to 22 degrees. However, I receive signals well so that‚Äôs good enough. If you‚Äôre any further north you‚Äôll have to get a non-standard mount, or possibly try installing it upside down, with the arm and LNB at the top. (This is for an offset dish)."

You want to edit the config.txt file, and find the section called USB Ethernet.\n[USB_ETHERNET]\nipaddr_eth = 192.168.1.200\nnetmask_eth = 255.255.255.0\nSet the IP to something for your network, ideally outside your router‚Äôs DHCP range.

I had to manually add a MAC address to the reserved IP, and now the router won‚Äôt give out .200 to anything else. Make sure you eject it/unmount it properly before disconnecting. You can then plug it into the network and see if you can ssh into it. The default username is root and password analog, and you should log in just fine.\nYou might also want to upgrade the firmware whilst you‚Äôre at it. DK1MI has a nice post on how to do that.\nI found the Pluto+ would make a new SSH key each time it booted up, and so SSH would complain that it didn‚Äôt match from last time (known_hosts) and prevent me from logging in.

    "text": "Networking\nThe Pluto+‚Äôs built in gigabit network port is very convenient. Connecting it to my network in its place under the dish wasn‚Äôt. My temporary solution was to run a cable out the bedroom window. This is fine as a temporary setup, and even okay overnight during the summer. However, it was not a long term solution. I am fortunate that my house was built with network ports in all rooms, but the room underneath the dish has network ports that are nowhere near the right side of the house for the dish. I also had the problem of getting it out of the house, as I‚Äôd rather not drill holes though the walls if I can help it.\nOur garage has the heating boiler in it, and so has several large air vents. These just have grills over them on the inside and outside of the house and so I decided one of these would be the perfect conduit for network cable to get out of the house. However, there are no network drops in the garage, and it‚Äôs a good 20-25 m along two walls of the house to get from the vent to the dish. I was wanting a network connection in the garage, as it‚Äôs where I plan on having a workbench/shack setup at some stage, and running cables isn‚Äôt exactly the hardest DIY one can do! A big drill bit, and a long spool of cable and away I went.\n\n\n\nSerious problems need serious solutions\n\n\nThe office backs onto the garage, and makes a good place to connect into the network. I ended up getting three drill bits as the first wasn‚Äôt long enough, the second was for masonary and I hit wood, and then finally the 40cm wood bit went the whole way through! For a while I was worried I‚Äôd hit a water waste pipe, or worse, soil pipe, as the bathroom is above me, but it turned out to be a wooden stud. I tried running the wire along the wall outside, but it looked messy. Being dark blue against a light finish didn‚Äôt help, and so then I buried it in the gravel instead.\n\n\n\nRoute to the outside\n\n\n\n\n\nUgly\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy\n\n\nThe only problem with the network cable is that the plug is made up inside the box, and so I can‚Äôt remove the box from its location. The coax is made up inside but I can disconnect the other end from the dish and just carry it with the box. The network cable is not quite as easy, given it‚Äôs 30m back to the network port. I left lots of excess, so if I really do have to move it, I can just cut off the plug and pull it out of the grommet.\nI did think I could make an outdoor network switch, and have jumper cables between the boxes, and this would enable me to setup something else outdoors. Like raspberry pis, or other SDRs. I‚Äôd need a power setup but that would be fairly straightforward as there‚Äôs an external plug socket nearby. That‚Äôs a project for another day.\nNext up will be the software!\n\n\n\nSDR Console"

This is one of the few handhelds that do full duplex, and is also packed with features, including APRS and GPS. This makes it ideal for FM satellites. I recently picked up an Arrow II handheld 2m/70cm antenna to use with it. This is a fairly lightweight dual band yagi, with built in duplexer. All the elements screw together through the boom and so it makes it quick to put away and assemble.\n\n\n\nKenwood radio with Sony voice recorder\n\n\nI do still need to read the D72‚Äôs manual as I was struggling to set up the memories and I think it only works in full duplex in a certain way. I presume A VFO as TX and B as RX but I could be wrong! I also realised the headphones use 2.5mm port and not 3.5mm.\n\n\n\nISS Detector AR View (whilst writing this post)\n\n\nAnyway, I thought I‚Äôd mess about with it at lunch time. I‚Äôve been investigating apps for tracking satellites and to find what‚Äôs coming next. I‚Äôve found ISS Detector with the Amateur radio satellites add-on to be a good option on iOS. I do have to manually add all the birds I want to use. Whilst it shows you the mode, there‚Äôs no filtering for it, and in fact when it shows FM, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a repeater for use. I need to reconcile the list against this tracking site, or this status site.\nIt just so happened that the ISS was in view, and the radio already had the voice frequency saved in the memory. So I started the recorder and tried to get my antenna in the right direction. It didn‚Äôt help that it was where the sun was and so it was hard to read my phone but the AR mode in the ISS Detector app makes it fairly easy to know where to point.\n\nTheodolite app ‚Äì still figuring this out too, but takes nice shots with all the info\nTurns out I was tuning into a planned school contact with Valley Stream South High School in New York state, who were talking with astronaut Andreas Mogensen, KG5GCZ, aboard the ISS. This is their livestream, although not that exciting to watch üòÖ. They had a ham, IK1SLD, who was co-ordinating the radio part and the school were patched in via the internet. His QRZ profile is quite interesting regarding the ISS and the telebridge ground station.\nAs I didn‚Äôt have a 2.5mm jacket for the radio, I balanced the voice recorder on my arm whilst trying to hold the radio, antenna, and phone to see where the ISS was. The pass over me didn‚Äôt last long, maybe 5 minutes max, and I managed to record a couple of minutes of the astronaut‚Äôs answers to the kids questions. Obviously I don‚Äôt hear the kids transmission.\n\n\nMy recording of the transmission. Edited to remove breaks.\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\n\nI ended up having to go and run errands and never got to work anything, but it was fun listening.
