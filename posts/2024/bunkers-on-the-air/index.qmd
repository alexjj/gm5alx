I've heard about it before but only just looked into bunkers on the air (or UK BOTA). Turns out there are a lot of sites around and good way to get out and about, use the radio, explore your local region and maybe learn a little bit of history.

Here's a list of useful sites to get you going:

* [Main site](https://bunkersontheair.org/site/)
* [Database](https://bunkerbase.org/)
* [Maps](https://bunkerbase.org/bunker-3/)
  * The Google Map didn't appear for me, but the OS map is nice, or use the combined on below:
* [Combined awards map](https://kwirk.github.io/pota-gb-map/)

The main rules are:

* Be within 1000 m of the bunker location (with the right permissions etc.)
* Qualify the bunker with 25 HF contacts or 10 VHF+ contacts

I'd recommend joining the WhatsApp group listed on the website, and you'll get invited to the spotting group too.

I was surprised by the number of bunkers locally to me, especailly compared to doing SOTA activations and having to drive at least an hour to get anywhere!

I've not activated one yet but there appear to be plenty that have never been done near me.
