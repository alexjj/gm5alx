![Summit, or at least what is visible from the road](creag-nan-gabhar-9.jpg)

Last week on the GM/ES activation day, Fraser was on this summit, and so I thought I'd go up and get a complete for me, and Fraser would go up a summit and get a complete for him! (Completing from a summit isn't necessary but it is much more fun that way!)

Following on from my [first summit](https://gm5alx.uk/sota/2025/gm-es-055/) this morning, I decided to wear some gaiters and take some hiking poles as I was sure there'd be more snow on this summit. Plus it was going to be another trackless ascent over heather and I didn't want to get soaking boots on this cold day.

There are a couple of routes up, and, as always, given I was on a tight schedule I picked the shortest route. This starts from the side of the road and follows a stream up, and then you turn and face the summit and go straight up to the top. Seems to be a theme today...

I expected the route to take me around 50 minutes, and the first 20 minutes were easy going along the stream. Once I crossed over that it was then time to head straight up. The hill side was quite sheltered, and even though the air was colder here (certainly felt a lot colder when I got out the car) than Meall Alvie, the lack of wind meant I was pretty warm on my walk.

The route up is whatever you can make it. Sometimes following streams, sometimes over heather and sometimes in grassy patches. There was a surprising lack of any snow here. The ridge you can see in the photo is circa 750m and there's no a single flake. Compared to Meall Alvie where there was snow around 500m, but I guess it's in the trees and this gets full sun as a south facing slope. I did have a sit down at one point as it's a bit of a slog, I suppose I had time extra too. Turning around, I was greeted with lovely views to the south of the higher hills all covered in snow.

I pushed on and made it to the top around the 50 minute mark. The top is quite a broad plateau with several cairns, and I relied on my watch to tell me which was the actual summit. Not that it really matters for SOTA given I have 25 vertical meters to play with. It was patchy blue sky but still great views all around. The only trouble was the icy wind that was strong now I was on the top.

I picked the largest cairn and put on all the jackets and hats I'd brought! Unfortunately, I only had my thin gloves and so my hands suffered the most. I had about 20 minutes before Fraser was due to arrive, so I wanted to do HF first and then be ready on 2m when he arrived. I setup again on 40m, and called CQ. The band was a little better for me this time. I did stop and then run around for a while to warm up, before going back to the radio for a few more QSOs.

With 11 on 40m, I packed up and setup the slim G for 2m. I'd just spotted on 2m, when Fraser did the same. So I jumped to his frequency and we had a wee chat. With that done, I was also done! I packed up and headed off back the way I came. Fraser was stuck on 3 QSOs, and was equally cold on his summit, so I dug out the HT with the RH-770 and gave him a call on the club callsign. He did manage two more afterwards. Once I was over the ridge and heading back down, I was out of the wind and my hands started to warm up...and burn up!

I was glad I took the poles, as they were useful for the steep descent, without them I suspect I'd have been rolling down the mountain. Back to the car, shovel down my super noodles, and then headed home. I made it back by 3pm, with enough time to get changed, make a cup of tea (cooled down with cold water!) and then head over to the school in time for pick up. üö∏

I think next time I come here, I'll take the longer, but shallower gradient route...at least I hope it's shallower! There's only a month left of winter bonus, where the objective is to activate as many summits as possible - as long as they're 2 or more pointers. So that means four more Fridays, and possibly a bonus day that I'll take off. The tricky part is choosing which summits to do. I want to complete all the GM/ES summits, but should I also repeat some I've already done during winter bonus period as I can do multiple in one day. Some of it does depend on the weather, so I'll see what's next. üèîÔ∏è
