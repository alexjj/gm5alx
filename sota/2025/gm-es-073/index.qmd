![Start of the walk](knockhill-7.jpg)

I was running a little behind schedule, but this next summit wasn't too far away and I thought I could get up it quickly enough. So a short drive later and I‚Äôm at the bottom of Knock Hill. It‚Äôs about a 230m vertical ascent over a short distance and it‚Äôs quite a slog when you‚Äôre trying to fit in time for tea, cake and banter in Huntly before school pick up back in Aberdeen.

Not long until the summit but this one seemed to be even windier than the last. I admired all the summit features and then headed back to the new fence and tiny tree for setting up.

There are some peat hags on the top which look like a golf course bunker, and would provide some nice shelter, but there was nothing to mount the mast to.

A quick round of everyone on 2m again, then it was time to chase Simon still on his summit. This time on 10m. Not quite as strong but still a clear 51 both ways. With enough in the log, and the tiny tree providing equally tiny shelter, it was time to head down and off to Dean‚Äôs for an enormous slab of malteser slice and tea.

We were so busy explaining igates, digipeaters and LoRa to Chris that we didn‚Äôt take photographic evidence of the cakes‚Ä¶at least not before I had to leave back to Aberdeen. To then run into a huge procession of bikers on the A90 doing 40 mph.

Lots of S2Ss, and four completes for me today! üèîÔ∏è Only two points today but lots of fun! Just Ben Aigan left up this part of the region, and I've chased Chris on it, so another complete awaits!
