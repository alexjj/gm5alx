A Friday off and time to find a summit. Weather hasn't been great but looked mild today, although could be windy. Mona Gowan is a straight forward 4-pointer which has a few routes up to it. I chose the most direct from the west, off the Old Military road. I'd driven 20 minutes and some flags flapping in the breeze reminded me I'd forgotten to pack my mast!
